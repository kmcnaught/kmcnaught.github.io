micro:bit LIVE 2021 | Over the Digital Gap: Remote Classes for the Disadvantaged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="ADFvh_srV4A
thank you very much um well it's absolutely great to be here um today um whatever time it is for you it's about lunch time for me um absolutely delighted to have the opportunity to speak to you and to talk a little bit about um our experience over the last sort of 18 months or so because it's fair to say that altitude foundation has um learned quite a lot um over the course of the pandemic um it had a real impact on the way that we deliver our activity on the way that we think about what we're doing and hopefully some of the things that i share with you today um you might be able to use um now in the future um in your own practice um firstly just to start off with a little bit of sort of context about ourselves um because i think it's important to understand um who we are and what we do um so we're based in the northeast of england we're a charity that focuses on supporting young people to access digital and tech careers but we're particularly focused on young people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and we know that in the northeast of england um there are plenty of communities that need that um additional support um in order for the young people there to to thrive the smash barriers to fulfill their potential and we believe that um digital careers um tech careers that kind of knowledge experience and skill set is so important um and such a great way for them to be able to um just do something really exciting with their with their lives um so we we cover a whole range of things but crucially and particularly in the context of this session we help them to um to develop their their skills their knowledge and their experience of programming and coding and it will come as no surprise to you that we use the micro bit as a key piece of tech to help us to do that so um i refer in the title to the the digital gap um you might know it as the digital divide you might know it as a digital gap you might know it um by other means but essentially what we're talking about here is the fact that um access to um digital technology access to um digital opportunities um there is a divide um based on socio-economic um circumstances and that that happens um right across the world i think it happened um anywhere um at all and really crucially um the thing to remember is that um it isn't the case that everyone is in a fortunate enough position that um like myself um i'm able to join you today um i've got my laptop i've got my webcam um i've got all my kits um and i've got a stable broadband connection i can access this that's no problem back in march of 2020 the uk went into lockdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and on a personal level i had to work from home i would stop at this desk that i'm sitting at now today and largely speaking i was able to get on with things um as i had been because i'm fortunate i'm lucky that um i have um a house with a decent broadband connection i've got the tech i've got the setup i've got somewhere that i can sit and work in peace and quiet um whenever my cats aren't disturbing me and it's very easy to take that for granted actually but one of the things that we find during lockdown was that um the young people that we were working with um uh really struggled actually and and there were a lot of communities experiencing socio-economic disadvantages that weren't as fortunate as i was or maybe as you were in terms of being able to access all of the the sudden explosion of remote and online content you know that that shifts the zoom you know i'm sure we've all you know used zoom we've used teams we've used google map we've used hop-in you know all of these technologies and solutions that helped us get around some of the challenges presented by lockdown not necessarily the easiest for absolutely everybody to address and we did participate in a little bit of research with a research collective called not equal talking about the experiences that our target beneficiaries were experiencing and those of other charities and you know they they talked about access issues they talked about the economic barriers actually to participating online because you've got to be able to pay for your internet connection and buy the kit that you need all of that sort of thing there were also fundamental issues of digital literacy so by that what i'm talking about is that you know some people just not familiar enough with the technology that they've got to be able to access the opportunities that are out there online and so on and so forth um and there were also um challenges and they needed with with culture change um that actually people were used to doing things a certain way and it wasn't easy for everybody to shift to a new way of doing things the sutton trust which is a a charity um in the uk that looks at social mobility issues identified that there was a real differential between um uh less well-off kids and their better-off peers in terms of the amount of um online content they were able to access um the the amount of time and that they were able to spend on it and a lot of that flowed from things like the number of devices that they had in the home um so you know the numbers are there on the screen i don't need to read them out to you but you can see that you know there were some fundamental issues for some of the less well-off kids um in our country and particularly um for from our focus in the northeast of england um and the government did um do a sort of a laptop roll out and that sort of thing to try and address these issues but it's fair to say that just ruling out laptops for kids to be able to access online content wasn't the only issue that they were experiencing and i want to come to some of the issues that that we sort of were we became aware of over the practice um of of dealing with this during lockdown but the crucial thing for us um was that we had been working with a cohort of young people um everything had been going really well up until march then we hit lockdown we shifted to remote and online delivery and we lost touch with i i would say at least half of our regular participants and not half of um our regular participants we didn't see again uh and we haven't worked with um since lockdown and there are all sorts of reasons why that might have been the case but it became a real sort of existential issue for us actually that we needed to think very very carefully about how we were delivering our activity to make sure that we were reaching the kids that we wanted to reach we weren't interested in just working with any kids who were able to access our material we were particularly interested in working with those kids who might not otherwise be able to access the kind of opportunities that we were providing this is very much our reason um for being our reason for existing our mission is to work with those kids who wouldn't otherwise get access to these kinds of opportunities the opportunities to develop their programming and coding skills to find out more about digital and tech careers so it really spoke to the very heart of what we do as a charity to try and figure out how exactly do we make sure that the activity that we are delivering is accessible that no matter what kind of background the kids are coming from they can participate in what we're delivering and we thought prior to lockdown in march 2020 that we'd thought about a lot of these issues because we'd said to ourselves we want to make sure that there are no barriers in place that we can possibly control to make sure that the young people that we want to work with have the greatest possible opportunity to take part in what we're doing so whenever we find that half of our participants just disappear almost overnight and we can't get in touch with them we can't get them along to the activities that we're delivering online and remote we needed to think very very carefully about what it was that we were doing how we did it to make sure that we were making our um activities accessible to everyone so sort of two aspects to this i think it's fair to say um this is the technology side of it and there's also a kind of a social side that i'll come to um in a second but what we learned um over the course of the the lockdown and as we sort of tested things out and experimented and trialled and um you know had to get really quite creative in terms of the way that we did things bearing in mind that previously what we did was a lot of schools based activity within the schools we use the school facilities we provided micro bits to the kids that we were working with and we allowed them to you know engage in our activity in that school setting um we obviously couldn't do that face-to-face with them the schools were were um you know the premises were closed everything was remote so we needed to think very carefully about what what we were doing the first thing that we realized was that all of our delivery had to be device agnostic and i mean to the point where we had to be able to make sure that the activity that we were delivering if um the young people that we were working with could only for example access it through a mobile phone we needed to make sure that they could do that so we weren't assuming that they definitely had a laptop we weren't assuming that they were definitely running windows that they could definitely access um you know a particular um platform for the delivery of content we had to as much as possible make sure that our delivery was device agnostic and they could access it from almost anything we needed to make sure that there was no specialist equipment because unlike whenever we were delivering in schools and we could assume that maybe the schools would have certain um pieces of kit or materials or we could bring them along and provide them with them you know particular technology or that kind of thing we needed to make sure that the delivery activities we were delivering required no specialist equipment whatsoever we also needed to bear in mind um that unfortunately in some homes um they didn't have um you know a stable broadband connection some kids were having to join our activity through um their mobile data um connections some um households were working off kind of broadband dongles and that kind of thing sometimes they did a broadband um connection but more than one person was trying to access content at the same time so we needed to make sure that we were avoiding sort of high data load activity as much as possible trying to keep it as simple and straightforward as possible and we also needed to make sure that we were accommodating a variety of abilities confidence levels that kind of thing because whenever you've got the kids in front of you and the schools are engaged and the staff and the schools are helping you out and that kind of thing it's very easy to support young people um coming from you know a range of different sort of ability levels whenever you're working with them remotely it's harder to pick up whenever um they're possibly struggling with um you know a particular aspect of what you're delivering you don't necessarily have the same level of support that you can put around them so we needed to make sure that the activity was flexible and it could accommodate that variety as best as possible but crucially there was also the social side which i think is often one of the things that gets overlooked um in these circumstances so as i mentioned to you before i'm very fortunate i've got a desk um it's in my bedroom in fairness but i've got a desk i've got a dedicated space that i can work from some of the young people that we were working with weren't necessarily going to have one of those kind of dedicated spaces they weren't going to have you know a quiet area in the home that they could um do things they were potentially going to be competing demands on their time um you know we've probably all experienced if we've gone through lockdown that feeling sometimes just having a day where do you know what everything just feels a little bit overwhelming you know you want to make sure that everything's kind of as simple and straightforward as possible as you're getting involved in it so we needed to really think about how do we facilitate um you know that social side of the digital divide because it isn't simply about the technology so we started to find things like making sure that they didn't need to have their video feeds on because if you don't have you know if you've got a lot of stuff going on in the background if you don't have a quiet space to sit sometimes you don't want people to be seeing all of that so we often said don't worry about having your video feed on we'll trust that you're there and you're accessing the content that's not a problem we also find that young people much preferred to engage with us through text chat sort of functions rather than switching on the audio and talking um for me i quite like you know talking i love chatting to people um i had no problem at all with getting on my zoom calls talking to my colleagues um you know having that kind of discussion felt a little bit different talking face-to-face but you know i got used to it that was fine but for some of our young people that was just too much of a barrier but using the text function using chat functions that was fine and actually we found that the engagement increased if we use those kind of um solutions we also had to recognize that we had to be flexible about when we were delivering activity so not just assuming that you know um the typical kind of after school time as we maybe would have been doing previously or you know always doing it um you know say on a saturday or on a wednesday evening or whatever it was we needed to be flexible um around the dates and times that we were actually delivering the activity and then one of the most important things we find was that we needed to keep things short and keep them simple so that meant um tailoring our activity and so that we could deliver it in a much much quicker kind of time frame than we maybe would have done whenever we were face to face we've probably all experienced that zoom fatigue that feeling of you know sitting in front of the screen for far far too long and just needing to get away from it all you know being in front of a screen all day every day is more tiring than being face-to-face being in person and that sort of thing so we find that you know if our young people that we were working with had for example being you know on you know remote classes at school all day coming on for another hour hour and a half of a session was sometimes just too much of an ask for them keeping it short keeping it simple keeping it straight forward we find that that improved engagement and immensely so the tech side and the social side both of those things we needed to address so what we found as well was that actually the micro bit was pretty much the perfect solution um for some of the things that we were trying to address um you know we were using the micro bit already but the micro bit for me really came into its own as we started to shift to this kind of online and remote delivery and that's for a number of reasons um firstly it's a standalone device if you've got a micro bit and something that you can program it from you can do your activity you don't need a whole bunch of peripherals it's great if you can add stuff to it but you don't need it because it stands alone it operates um on its own terms if you need it to you've got the make code editor browser based i go back to that idea of being device agnostic you can use it anywhere the micro bit classroom was great for us to be able to see the kids code give them feedback talk to them about what they were doing provide them with code if they were struggling a little bit great facility to just make sure that we were still able to do that sort of back and forth with them and being able to code in the blocks based editor and also in javascript or python was great because it meant that we could accommodate those um varying ability levels that i mentioned before so actually the micro bit for us as i say really came into its own and one of the things that i really like about the make code editor i must say is the fact that if we're working with young people who don't have a micro bit you've got the simulator which is just fantastic because it means that you can say to the kids all you need is a device that can access the internet and a browser and we can take you through whatever it is that we're doing so the micro bit was absolutely crucial for us case studies i want to give you is an activity that we um called code and sand and the idea there was that we we took the kids through a coding activity um so what you've got here is a screenshot um of of us in the middle of showing them how to code a particular um a bit of it and the idea was that they would code it um they would follow along with us they sent us um their code and then we showed them their code in action on a micro bit so that was for those kids who didn't have that piece of technology for themselves um at home so they were able to go on to the editor they were able to code along with us they sent us the code and then they were able to say oh i've just lost that hang on a second why's that stopped let me try that again i'm not sure why that quit so yeah they were able to follow along with this which was absolutely um crucial they were able to send the code to us and then we were able to show them and actually show their code coming to life um so a couple of things that i've highlighted on the screen there obviously um in the the sort of the main element of the screen is us sharing the code that we're doing allowing them to code along with us um but over um on the side hopefully what you can see there is that there are some video feeds that my colleagues presenting the activity taking the kids along showing them the code in action the kids themselves their video feeds were off they were engaging with us in the chat um and that was far far easier for them it cut down on the bandwidth requirement um it was much more comfortable for them and they got as much out of the session as they would have done if the video feeds were on a simple thing but actually really important for making things um more accessible for them another case study i wanted to share with you um was what we called our code cooperatives um so these um are sessions that we we still run um but we had to shift to delivering them remotely um when the schools were open um but they weren't allowing any visitors on site and what we were able to do there um actually was start to deliver activity in parallel and one of the interesting things for me is that you know some of what we did during lockdown was born out of necessity it was because we had to do it we didn't have a choice but what we find was that some of the things that we were doing we wanted to continue um so running our code cooperatives remotely um delivering stuff through the microbit classroom using the make code editor um you know using whatever the um the schools wanted us to use in terms of was it zoom was a google meet whatever it was um to deliver the activity the kids were on site in school in computer classrooms we were in the office or at home um depending on the circumstances delivering the activity remotely but it meant that we were actually able to deliver activity to more than one school at once um and uh what we what we actually do now with some of our schools um is we've just continued that because they said you know what this really works for us and from our perspective it means that instead of us having to go to five or six different schools separately and try and find the time for all of that we deliver one session to all of them at the same time it enables us to be in more than one place at once so this is actually one of those things where you know as i say born out of necessity in the first instance but actually we've continued um to do it um and the final case study that i want to mention to you isn't actually microbit related but there's a key point um that i want to come to for for why it is that i'm sharing this case study with you um because one of the things that we actually did during lockdown um in the end was we created um pen and paper based coding activities because we said to ourselves if we want to be maximally accessible if we want to make sure as many kids as possible can access this activity can we deliver um the coding and programming concepts that we want them to understand and learn without even needing to use a device at all so we created coding at home which is a booklet of activities that they could use um during lockdown um one of the examples there they've given you just a sort of a little snippet of was about um decomposing um recommendation algorithms the idea there being look you know if we really want to remove any possible barrier to engagement can we do it without without any reference to tech but still make sure that they're learning the fundamental concepts and the reason for that um i think is um or there are many many reasons um but but k i think is um actually that second point on on what is my final slide here which is to to be clear on what is necessary what's sufficient and what's optional and and one of the things that i would say is that there are plenty of things um that frankly you you would you would do if you had the opportunity um i am the first to accept and admit that in the vast majority of cases delivering activity for young people face to face where they can get hands-on with the microbit where they can add the peripherals on and where they can do all sorts of different complicated complex things that that is you know preferable in the vast majority of instances but when your back's against the wall whenever you still want to deliver that activity you really have to ask yourself well what is the fundamental thing that we're trying to do what is the absolutely necessary thing and we said well actually what we're really fundamentally trying to do here is to help them to understand programming concept key foundational um aspects of what it means to program something and to break down a problem to see your way to your solution all of that kind of thing so we were really really clear about what is it that's actually necessary um what's sufficient what will do in the circumstances that you find yourselves in and and what is it that maybe you know you would prefer to do it you would like to do it it might be better to do it if you could but it is ultimately an optional thing um in the overall grand scheme of things and that's why i say you know don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good because you know there is always sort of a way you know you want to add all of the things and you want to get it all sort of whiz-bang really exciting really cool all that sort of thing but um it is the case that sometimes you can still get that core concept the really important thing that you're trying to get across without giving you know that taking it to that kind of perfect um level and that means being creative it means thinking outside the box um you know we probably wouldn't have dreamt up all of the the sort of the ways that we um dreamt up to address the issues that we were facing if we hadn't been presented um with a lockdown with social distancing with schools being closed all of that kind of thing but by doing that it really made us understand far better the barriers that the young people that we were i'm trying to work with are actually experiencing and it's enriched and improved the activity that we deliver now now that we're not experiencing the same kind of restrictions in terms of delivery it's made us much more acutely aware of those technological and social barriers and the thing that i kind of want to leave you with is that sense that we need to be so acutely aware of the um of those barriers we need to go beyond the technological barriers that they might be facing that we can probably guess around you know the type of tech they have and that kind of thing but also to think about the social barriers that the young people that we're wanting to work with might be addressing because if we do that then ultimately we work with a broader range of young people which i think is absolutely key you know i think we're all united by a belief that we want to broaden the number of young people that are developing these core and critical digital skills we want to make sure as many of them as possible are able to access you know those kind of experiences um and that means being really really clear about um where those barriers come in and where you can actually remove that barrier for them and make it easier for them to be able to access the content that you're delivering um so that is a really quick run through of of some of the things um that we've done um over the course of the past 18 months and say you know of some things that we're actually still continuing because we find that in some cases it's a better way of doing things than we've done them before but i wanted to leave it there because if there are any questions if anyone has anything that they want to ask i'm more than happy to take questions at this point so it just remains for me to say thank you so much for coming along and listening to me today um it's been great to spend time with everyone virtually um at microbit live and i look forward to seeing you um here and in the next sessions if anyone has any questions happy to take them thank you okay so up until this point uh i think everyone's just been super engaged with your talk colin uh so we we don't have any questions leading up to this point but of course we do still have um a couple minutes so if if anyone would like to hop in with a question uh now in the chat please feel free in the meantime colin thank you so much for for your session um still super important i mean as much as well i mean in a couple ways as much as i i'm sure we're all just ready to uh be beyond the you know covet learning situation and the remote learning and all that um i think fact the matter is is in some ways the remote learning is is inclusive and more supportive um regardless right it's just kind of the you know it may just be the new norm moving forward um for some um but also you know it for some you know we just are still forced into that situation and even this past uh week i was doing some classroom visits and i just i feel like some of the topics you covered just in terms of the the accessibility of it and just taking into consideration the needs of each individual student we were doing some some minecraft work and some of the students that were watching it was too much for their devices to be able to tune into the lesson and also run sorry for the puppy barking um and also you know too much to watch and also participate um and so of course you know that's where the the micro bit shines is it's you know low maintenance and and as you mentioned it it doesn't perfect doesn't need to be you know as as much as i'm sure so many of us educators and and so many of the people that i'm sure are here uh attending microbit um i'm sure we have a lot of outstanding educators here that love to go above and beyond um and sometimes it's important just to take a step back and and you know it's just a matter of can the student participate at all because if if we're trying to overload them you know yeah i think it was just so interesting for us that we thought that we had challenged our assumptions around what the barriers were and and lockdown really forced us to reassess that and realize that actually you know we thought we were a charity that had got this right and we hadn't you know there was still more that we could learn um you know because i always sort of think to myself that there's some easy stuff here around um you know if you say you know come along to our coding club bring your own laptop right you probably you know can guess that for some kids they're not going to have a laptop that they can bring along so that means automatically they're not coming along to the coding club you know um but it was all that other stuff around you know but oh you know purchasing um you know a piece of kit or a peripheral or you know having a quiet space to do something or that kind of thing and it was like well actually we can we can do a lot with the kids that we're working with simply with the make code editor on all they need um you know i can see someone in the chat that has mentioned about you know um working on a single phone screen that's exactly it like you you that's not id you know you you would you wouldn't do it if you chose to but you can if you need to um and you can actually do quite a lot if if you're prepared to be inventive and creative and say well you know what what is actually like the absolute fundamental necessity here and what's the nice to have absolutely yeah and that's why it's so important that we that we talk about it you know it's i as as much bad that has come from the pandemic it's also as you mentioned you know whether for um you know your charity or just for a lot of educational institutions like it it's really forced us to realize the uh divide across you know a lot of our students even just you know within the same classroom um i've you know again with some of those online classroom visits that i've done you you see some students and and they they have a question to ask but they're also in a room with three of their siblings that are also in class and you know and and that's even if they're lucky enough to each have a device as as you know tanya mentioned just the the availability of time and access to say a device in a in a household so you know i mean i'm sure we can go on and on and on but just the main point being you know calling importance of of your session today and the importance of continuing to have these discussions um because it's you know regardless of the pandemic this will continue to be an ongoing barrier that that we as educators need to be uh as you said creative and inventive uh about how we support our students so uh with that being said we are we're wrapping up towards the end of our time so you know colin if you if you do happen to have anything else you want to mention i just you know before you do i just want to say thank you once more for an amazing session and and uh everyone in chat thank you uh for your ongoing participation it's it's been an incredible day um colin if yeah if you have anything please feel free to take it away otherwise i'll i'll close this off no i i think i've probably spoken enough for for everyone to say but just to say like genuinely thank you so much for the opportunity to come and speak today um because you know it was really important um to to me into the charity to be able to share some of our experiences and what we've learned because if it helps someone else then then we're delighted and if it expands opportunities then that's what we're here for amazing and i'm sure that's that's what a lot of us are here for is to contribute um so thank you again colin hope you have a great uh day and get to warm up a little um and thanks so much everyone have a great rest of your day you uh may press the leave button in the top right of your screen i don't know if i'm pointing the right way but have a great rest of your day and then you can choose your next session over on the left hand side take care everyone
