i am on it i'm just right here at the um i'm getting to my window with the power points um i'm going to share with you guys a little bit about how we um work with our high school leaders to lead content so i can see that you guys can see the link let me see if i can if i switch it to powerpoint show will it i'm gonna leave it you know as a non-show so i'm sorry if you guys are gonna have to look at this and think what is she doing but it might be easier just to tell you a little bit about our group so first of all it's a group of high school leaders who are working out in the community and they have created a kit and we're just going to talk about how we improved the kit this year and what we do with the kit is we deliver content to fifth graders in a remote setting so these are my students here that are um that designed the kit and a little bit about their work is they create the content that actually is going to be delivered and then they also decide what are we going to talk about when we're presenting this so they even come up with how they're going to describe loops and variables they design their own curriculum so i'm really proud of the work that they do and i wanted to just share how we changed our kit in the next year so we went back to our kits after we delivered this content we decided what did we need to change and so some of the things we changed is we started with using the nails and the alligator clip and we wanted to do that soil moisture sensor lab and we liked it but we found that that wasn't enough for the students to get engaged and it was particularly difficult because we're delivering it through a remote setting so this year we changed it up to say we're going to use duct tape we're going to use headphones and the alligator clips so that students can make more wearables so they can kind of take it home with them so they can do some more remote learning that was more engaging for them and so that's the change that we made in this so if you're somebody who's thinking like i don't know if we are going to have to deal with the lockdown we don't know what's next if i could recommend things like duct tape auxiliary headphones you know with the jack that you can use or even a piezo buzzer would be something pretty awesome for kids to be able to connect the alligator clip you know if they have a version one um micro bit that's a way to solve that problem and they could make a cool wearable so i wanted to just share out what we did to make those changes as people think about what is the future what are we going to do with the remote learning so we liked the sound labs servo motors i still have problems with the servo motors so i know that pauline mass did a session earlier today where she talked about using that um not using copper tape but using that fabric tape that's conductive that might be easier because servo motors to me would be a great or an issue but i liked what you just said we about using the um the data that you might get so that might be something as a solution but for us we were at cost prohibitive issues so we kind of thought what things work what things don't and then finally i'll just say the why it comes down to the why we want to get kids engaged in learning we especially want our high school students to kind of take on that piece and so we wanted tools that made them more productive and tools that will make them more successful when they're delivering a training so these are what we kind of our lessons learned and also just a way to kind of um kind of share in the community what's been working for us as we're delivering this online training yeah thanks dave that's the way i feel about it too hi jacqueline good morning so that's it for my presentation i hope it gave us more time if there's more questions for everyone
