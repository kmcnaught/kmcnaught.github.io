there you go so hi um so as i've been introduced let's see if i can get powerpoints to change um i have already yes there you go so oh that's gone too many times is it today so um i work for software cornwall and we're based in cornwall in the south far far south west of the united kingdom we're quite isolated down here it's uh a county of about half a million people um we have 32 secondary schools and 231 primary schools it's a fairly small region in terms of numbers but very lucky in terms of acreage or distance to travel to do outreach um so i've been doing this job since 2017 primarily in secondary schools but also i've been trying to reach out to primary schools as well so i have about 30 primary schools i have been into and visited about 26 secondary schools so doing assemblies and all kinds of things so picture on the left there is me at a conference an agile programming conference back in the summer last year and on the right there that's a presentation we were running um at that conference with my colleague nikki who runs the marketing and myself who does the outreach so please powerpoint make a change it's not oh there we go so yeah so yeah reach out into all the schools doing all kinds of things the schools want me to do um assemblies uh usually to about 200 or more pupils at a time uh on the top left there we actually have a skills fair that was produced for all the schools in cornwall i can't remember how many companies were there but it was in a huge conference area in cornwall and we managed to get i think six of our companies there my colleague darion shirt works for a laser he has a laser company so he was showing students how using music you can change the picture of a laser that he uses um normally projecting onto buildings for other purposes another company there with a water plant monitoring system that some students have built on an exercise they've done with them and another company had also bought tesla and we'd actually hacked into it into the api and students were able to run a small piece of python code on one of the pi top seed computers you see on the right hand picture those green ones you could run a short piece of python code and the doors were done the lights were in the horn reboot fantastic everyone loved it especially the fact they get to play with the tesla um so yeah so i do all kinds of little things the bottom right there um a typical kind of scene i rock up with my computers we get children working together to solve various exercises i set set to them that one particular one was quite a good day i actually had a whole morning with the students so we spent a great deal of time with them and a greater great get a great effort i don't usually get as much time with that i usually get one session and then i'm out um our main thing we run is a mission to mars work experience for older students about the age of 15 upwards um we do this three to five times a year um the main one as you can see pictured here we normally have about 30 students the other ones i think about 15 to 16. last year i took this online so instead of just having students locally within cornwall who could travel to our venues i was actually able to engage with students all around the united kingdom and it proved so popular i was actually three times oversubscribed for the session i ran easter last year during the lockdown so virtual is a way to go in the future and i'm going to do blended real and virtual at the same time um we also run weekend events called the tech jam rather like a rather like a raspberry pi jam part of the same session damn rise pasties and programming um on the right hand side is something i wanted to show you is something else i ran for a year or so sponsored by spaceport cornwall um it was a way of highlighting industries and technology inside the united kingdom and sorry inside cornwall so we got students to draw little pictures um onto which they could put on our map of cornwall the pictures represent an activity and we would then highlight using coding what activity you could use uh what technology you could use with that particular activity and as you touch the picture the activities light up on the lighthouse an led on the left hand side of the picture that's about four meters four meters wide so we made interactive art and coding all in one piece which was great fun um it's been quite successful on this we've won an award for our mission tomorrow's work experience on the left-hand side in 2019 and on the right-hand side we were a outreach provider of the year in the south and south west which included wales as well which is also a great recognition for all the work that we've done going into schools and spreading the word about technology industry and careers inside um the industry that's primarily what we are about i'm not going out doing the teaching the tea coding is the fun bit the reason i do this is that we have an industry about a hundred companies who are part of software cornwall who need new staff and this is an outreach long-term outreach event to get students coding to come and work for us but not only to work for us but realize you can get a very well paid career in cornwall portland is um very much an area a poor region of the uk there's rather large areas of deprivation but there is also a thriving technology industry here and we want students to realize that it's not doom and gloom down here i mean we have some fantastic countryside amazing surfing and seas and beaches and things like that the rest of the country come down here every summer it's fantastic but there's not a lot of really good jobs the software industry have it this is why we are doing this there is a reason for us doing this um so the micro bit than us i've loved the micro bit ever since it came out which is way before i got this job um the reason i like the micro bit it's physical computing you're actually having something in your hand teaching computing in schools so much is just based on a screen to actually have something in your hand and an led a button you can press and noise you can make things like that engage with students so much more and we know that from our cornwall tech jams it's interactive as well you can make it do things by touching it by pressing the buttons and things like that it's also creative one of the sessions i run is to get students to design their own little pictures on the leds again i only get about an hour to do this so even that particular one there you can see in the in the image someone has chosen a surfboard or why wouldn't you live in cornwall it's a major activity down here so that's their own image of surfboard on a micro bit and if we have the time and they're particularly good class i actually get them to animate their image as well add things to it so they can then switch the images around to make them animate which is great fun it's a lovely activity it's creative activity so it engages with students who aren't into particularly into coding they are creative there's definitely a need for that um so for coding for me i'm a visitor in schools i do not work in schools so i have real problems with wifi um i don't get it i go into a school i ask for website access things like it doesn't happen guaranteed i can't do it the microbit.org website totally unreachable inside of school as a visitor i cannot guarantee it's going to work or i exclusively use new editor because i can download that onto our raspberry pi pythons i know it's there i know it's going to work it's also before they updated the micro bits website i can flash the code from a micro but from the program editor to the micro bit instantly there's no dragging dropping and file changing and stuff like that as it was originally when it first came out so we use all our own equipment all i need is desks chairs power supply and students that's all i need to rock up and then i know everything is under my control if something fails i know the reason for it i don't have to ask for any assistance i know from experience it doesn't work as a visitor wi-fi installs we always get the children to work in pairs it's a primary way of coding in our industry people would very rarely work by themselves and companies quite often we would do mob programming as well so you know um employees will work up to maybe eight people on one computer seven seven of them discussing the code one of them driving the computer and the person driving has no contribution to the code but after 10 minutes they swap out somebody else sits down and somebody else carries on everybody knows what's going on i explain this to students every single time and also pair programming is another good reason for it two brains twice the power if one is not quite getting it the other one can explain it and we always say that all code from one brain to the computer has to pass through somebody else's hands if you know the answer and you're typing you have to hand the keyboard over to your partner or the other person in the team and tell them what it is and explain what it is everybody has to be able to scratch and i go around the class or the mission to mars work experience and say what's that line of cloak can you explain it and if i know someone is maybe not up to scratch i will ask them to explain it then if they can't i say to the team right you need to be able to explain all the code i'll come back and test you again in a minute it's not just a matter of getting it right everybody must understand it um i also do live coding with the class um i have done worksheets i do create worksheets write them all out create them as pdfs which we put in the raspberry pi's or sometimes print them out i do find that students do this too much in class already they have a worksheet you do a you do b you get c my worksheets don't work like that i give you a b's missing something you won't get to see unless you really think about it um but i do that in the live coding as well so i use a radio controlled uh keyboard i have new up on the screen or projected or whatever at the front of the class and i'm in amongst the pupils coding live as i go trying to remember how to do without notes so i make mistakes students see that and i can do things on the fly i can change things somebody asked me a particular question i said well okay let's try it and i just type it in and where it goes um i find that works really well with students it means that i can actually take ideas from them and add that to my code at the same time but it's still under the prescriptive class what i'm trying to do it's um yeah keeps it live keeps it real that's that's the best thing about it and with younger children as well uh in year sevens and below uh year sevens of the first year in secondary school in the uk your sixes and year fives about the ones uh i do in the primary schools they're kind of years nine and older um they are so receptive to this and they just love the idea um oh yeah put a few few coding options before year nine most schools don't offer a great deal um quite often i could be the only person going in there doing it a lot of teachers don't seem to have the the knowledge base yet we are trying to increase that in this region and the national centre of computing education is here and they are getting out of the schools and it is better but it is knowledge-based amongst the students um and the main one thing as i have mentioned before i only get one one-hour session with the students i don't go back into a school again and again and again as i said there's 231 primary schools in the region i don't have the time to do that this is your one-off careers visit but with coding thrown in and i hope to engage with the students to make them realize that this is fun this is really cool you can do some really fancy stuff with it i tell them about all the things we do and that they can do as they get older and progress through as well and also highlight that coding is a it's a community down here the technology industry um we all get together we all kind of know each other it's a very small closed community not closed very open actually very friendly um but if you re come along network with us even as youngsters we have youngsters who come to our tech jams who then grow up into secondary school and then come along to a mission to mars in the end come to work for some of our companies we have had students who do that and it's amazing to see them come through and doing that just in a short time it's meeting people greeting us because one day you never know and it has happened it happened to me you come and volunteer or come and visit to one of our events you could actually meet your future employer and you go for an interview one day and that person is sitting in front of you but you know them they know you all of a sudden the interview is far more friendly far more um you know everybody knows each other because it's a small small region um i've mentioned creativity quite a bit at the beginning of the pandemic i put out a worksheet for some students to do um using um slug copper slug tape which are fantastic resource especially the micro bit with the crocodile clips um creating some art so you literally touched the the boat and a message came up calling saying cool we are in li and then you touch the bottom of the uh rock on the lighthouse and the light came off um i love doing that that was a great fun one to do being creative i think is a great way to get people who are who could be so good in our industry but often get ignored i know when i go into schools when i have a class of boys in the class that the teacher has sent me the boys they haven't chosen to be there but i know we have to get all the students so this particular session i've got here illustrated is from uh an all girls school and they love it they really get it because you go in doing something creative and they love it and that's across the whole school year as well i mean it's a whole it's a primary school to secondary school to senior school and they love it so i know it works but i know the teachers and and possibly parents are the guardians to the students as some illustrations of my art i've done there's some whole group of art on the left hand side there results the students creating our own things on the right hand side coming up to christmas which i'll be doing this week this coming week we put the micro bits behind some 3d printed snowflakes um they're not currently stuck i was going to demonstrate this but i can't do that because i'm doing a session with 90 students on monday so all my micro bits are packed up and ready for work on monday morning in the back of my car so the ones i have here are my spares um so yeah um specific events as well and i'm running out of time but we'll get there um we also have tech girls here in cornwall uh run by an ex-director of one of our software companies um she is doing some amazing stuff she has incredible contacts and during the um where it was now the g7 that's right g7 in cornwall last um summer we had an event called the green hack week and i wrote some coding sessions for that based on uh collecting plastic waste on the beach and as you went down the beach you picked up a piece of plastic you clicked button a i think and if you um it was a piece of non-fishing plastic you press button b and then you would tally it up and at the end you press the button press both buttons together and it will give you the result of how many pieces of plastic fishing and otherwise you've actually collected so i actually had a school session to do um back in october so the g7 was back in was it june may or june and one of the young girls who've done that coding mentioned she'd done that so it had actually made an effect and someone she said she really enjoyed it it was great fun that she went and did a beach connect so producing these things does help just drip drip drip all the time little things um we've got a museum does um telegraph museum port carno for the satellites with the cables from morse code and things used to come up the beach into cornwall and i went down there and created this little satellite that increased the range of the micro bit radio there's a long corridor there so this kernel satellite had a micro bit in it which listened to messages to it and then retransmitted them but translated them in the process so one micro bit you'd write the code to send a morse message and then the satellite would receive it translate it and then send the plain text message to another micro bit at the far end of the corridor out of range of the first satellite the first microphone so that was a cool one that was just for a museum day event um also this is a one i've tried i've used this a little bit i've created an evaluation monitor i've seen so many people going to schools visitors and things like these sheets of paper how do you rate this paid to be you know between one and five is this good is this bad i've been handing out a class set of micro bits pre-programmed and they hold the micro bits in their hand so what i want you to do is answer this question if it's a positive response i want you to wave your hand for me like that to shake on the microbit and i'd say what was this question please and then the children's would shake and their smile would come up on their microbit might they would send a radio message to my micro bit and i'll have an answer of how many of them were positive about that response they didn't ask another question question two and at the end i just used my micro bit hit both buttons and it would then read off question one so many were positive question two so many were positive and i just write this down and there's my evaluation live with a micro bit so this welcome to our mission to mars rovers so these are our work experience rovers um we normally program these with an arduino where's my camera out there i like an arduino using c plus plus language i do this for year year nines and up so yeah so yeah you're nines and up um so slightly more complicated coding i give a little head start but it's great fun the year for lower years we have the ability to put it to plug in a micro bit so we can plug each switch these two devices in and out it could do one or the other so there's two ways we can do this the quick one is what i'm going to show you today is actually a radio control so you actually have one micro bit with the radio control you tilt it one way little arrow comes off here sends a radio message to the other micro bit and the rover will move forwards um can you do that session in about um how long does it take about 45 minutes at a push so i do need a bit of time to do this i'm going to run this over here i'm going to have to move my computer slightly off the side of my desk this is going to get a bit jittery see anyway i can do this so hopefully you will now be able to see the rover on the floor behind me and if i tilt this has already got the radio on it's already oh let's turn off there we go unplug it turn it back in again and if i tilt it the rover moves now i don't show the pupils that working when i do the exercise i go in with a dead rover and tell them that until you put code on the rover nothing works so i think that's the end of my slideshow oh it's the future okay i'll do the future first in the future i hope to do neopixels we already have some little neopixels and pieces of car then we have neopixel rings as well we use but my office has just recently been renovated the whole building has been renovated and we have a brand new office inside it but we have neopixels on the outside 15 000 neopixels fully programmable we hope to in a week or so time be told how we can access these and we're going to work out if we can run some lessons inside the building of an evening in the autumn of winter students can have a go on the cards or little other things we might purchase at the time program those and we then ship it into the building and you go outside and they see the code running on the building so looking forward to that so i'm going to stop sharing because i need to share something else um i hope all right where is it mr mew put you across there escape there's move gone sorry i've just lost mu i think it's powerpoint she's hiding it here we go so sharing mu yes so let's maximize that so now you should see mu let's make that a bit bigger for you that works so this is the code i give on a worksheet or working live with the students it's not very complete but it's quite basic and i take it through them and explain it to them so all that does is the bit i showed you which is turns the rover's wheels on the first student to get that working and i s well first student i see that has the code right i tell them to flash it onto the micro bit i give them a battery box for the for the micro bit you plug it in put the rover on the floor turn it on this one is already pre-programmed before i go in and then they do that and all of a sudden the class come alive if you've had a few stragglers or students who aren't particularly interested all of a sudden they see a rover drive across the floor oh my god it's fantastic it really gets them going all of a sudden everyone is really concentrating on getting it going it's great fun so then they go back to the the worksheet and there's some other code in there some other information that they have to put together so they have to just build up the l-sits for the motions i've only given them the forward i haven't told them how to do the rest all i do is give them some things that you know you can turn it left and right backwards and forwards and obviously the rover's got to go forwards and back left and right and there's arrows for the compass printed on the top so we have an arrow facing north here at the moment so so what do we do i said well it's not difficult what do you think it's doing at the moment what do you think the f means usually someone say forward okay so what's the opposite forwards and they go backwards ah okay so what letter would it be correct so about going left or going right so then they add it in ah okay and then i put in an else at the end with an s for stop to be honest it doesn't really matter if it if they don't have the stock or not because the stock is already built into the rover but the whole idea is that that's the else the stop is the flat so i only tell them how to do forwards backwards left and right and then they can kind of do the rest and by the end of the lesson the majority will have had will have had some code run on the rover and a large number of them have probably done the whole remote control and as each team completes it i get them to then go and help the ones who may be struggling a little bit so with a class of 30 students in 15 teams by the majority at the end of a 45 minute to an hour lesson everyone is running the rover so yeah it's great fun and they really get it and then i explain you know what pair programming the careers what we're doing the mission to mars in the future when they get a bit older they can do the rovers and they come in and do all kinds of things we've got you know ultrasonic sensors on the front so it doesn't bump into things ultrasonic sensors underneath so it doesn't fall off a cliff because they have to drive it up a slope and it must fall off the other end we have sensors on the front here as well and the moustache as i call it so it has to follow a light the beam it has to be at a under full control driving perfect straight lines and i need perfect straight lines um there's no line following it's a mission to mars there is no lines on mars you have to be completely autonomous so that's what we do for that and then another thing i do is if we have slightly longer time is to make it slightly more complicated especially if the slightly older students you know years year eight and nines maybe um they have to set up the whole rover and i will do this uh live line by line explaining how you turn on one motor which is the line six seven and eight pair if you can turn on one motor that's the command for one motor we put it in the micro bit they actually put the micro bit in so the rovers are dead on the floor they take their micro bit from their computer plug it in switch it on and then the motor should run and the road will go around in the corner in a circle because only one motor is working so right well done you've got a motor working and again people hear the motor running something's happening so right i've shown you how to write one motor can you get the other motor going the only difference is a left and a right so you have to go and then figure out how to put it in and when i think they've got it right we've got two motors running okay you've worked out how to get one two motors running you can make the rover go forwards how do you make it stop how do you make it run for a specific amount of time so each time i'm making the ones who are getting faster going ahead more complicated and the ones i'm helping i then have more time to help the ones who may be struggling and then if they're really good i get them to do it in functions my favorite story about this functions is from a school in camelford i had a real mixed class of students it was lovely because it was p they were picked from everywhere it was a really good session and that's where i'm actually going on monday same school i had a couple of students a couple of girls who were english students that was their thing they were coming on they'd be told to come along to cody class but they were english students really enjoyed it and i was going through the names of functions that functions have to be named so that they mean something and they said can we um we like shakespeare can we can we write the names in like shakespeare and i said yeah sure yes you can so they were saying define rover move thee forwards vow shout stop it was brilliant they had a whole name list of functions like that it's so good i had to photograph it and then showed it to show it to everyone but it's where you get creative minds coming into coding thinking about what you could bring into it and then realizing how it all works it's great this is quite technical but it's the creative people i love interacting with and getting them involved it's not just the techies and the geeks i think this kind of thing is open to everyone we need all those kind of resources those kinds of people in coding so yeah so that's bang on four minutes left i reckon that's pretty good going you can still practice with this in terms of um assemblies i get 10 minutes and then i go in there by the way you've got eight minutes okay so our stop share do anyone have any questions i've not been reading the questions i've been talking so much um it's great approach to make students connect with you and let them know that even teachers are learning yes yeah teachers i mean yeah teachers are learning as well they're learning new things i sell to the students that your teachers won't know this bit and they love it that i go in and do something different the teachers can't do or they think of something that i haven't thought of i said yes you could do that why not um do you have an internet link for your lesson plans or projects um no i can share some stuff with us um i have tried sharing in the past to be honest no one's ever picked up on it um i'm quite happy to they're not lesson plans by the way they are literally worksheets for the students um and then i just go in and pick out pieces that i can present live myself you really do have to know what you're presenting and you really do have to know when things go wrong where they go wrong exactly how to pick it up without any puns and hers and things like that which is why i'm using my own equipment when i go in so if i'm using school equipment and we have tried this things go wrong you have different sessions different values of chrome using internet explorer still things just don't work um do i have a single rover for the whole class um we actually have six of these now as of this summer we have six but i go in with two two i can handle by myself six is a bit of a handful when i'm dealing with lots of young students especially when they're running around a small classroom i often might stand on things like that um or do they have one for each pair no i wish they did that'll be really good but these are a few hundreds of pounds each and we have no funding to do this at the moment we are totally unfunded in terms of outreach we had funding um for 2017 to 2019. we are looking for more funding at the moment to run outreach it's a bit of a shoestring thing at the moment but we have the rovers we have all the resources um and to be honest the pandemic has pretty much shut down school visits i'm not doing anywhere near as much i used to do at least four a week i'm probably doing maybe three a month at the moment and that's only in the last couple of months it's very very quiet i'm so looking forward to getting back into schools and doing the 90 students on monday with three sessions three classes it's going to be fantastic um yeah oh did you design the pcb for the micro bit interface yes that was my request our original rovers were designed primarily for the only for the arduino and i used to have to where the pins are for the arduino which is here you take the arduino i would literally have a one of these boards um for the micro bit um blue tacked onto the back of the rover and then jumper leads into the right pins and then map it myself so when we have the new ones in the guy who was making them for us one of the companies software companies that said he said you know there's anything you want yes i would love to have this and it's brilliant absolutely brilliant um no it's not a commercial product it's all hand built and we can't sell them either because of um kite marks and eu coding things and stuff like that it'll be too too expensive for us to do they're bog standard chassis but it's just our own board so yeah it's been really cool amazing thank you so much robert right on time you answered all the questions as well so it all came together i think it's amazing to see the new and innovative things that that are happening so thank you thank you thank you everybody in chat for listening we are now over to our last interactive session um for the conference and then we have our closing so very excited robert thank you so much once again for your time and for coming out and then i will see everybody at microbit live um in the next session so let's go there thanks everyone for listening thank you thank you robert ice bushra that was good it was fantastic doesn't it feel nice to be done [Laughter] it's too perfect thank you everybody thank you
