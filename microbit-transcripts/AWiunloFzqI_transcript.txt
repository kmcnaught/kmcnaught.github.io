micro:bit LIVE 2021 | Tech Team Update
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="AWiunloFzqI
hello everybody i'm all around the world it's my pleasure to be drawing this second section of the micro bit live conference to a close i'm talking a little bit about how the microbit tech team thinks about what we do in technology and how we make technology deliberately distinguishable from magic before i leap into those slides and an update from the tech team i just want to say how exciting it is to have all of these people all this energy online in a virtual conference again this year talking about the creative exciting incredible things people are doing teaching with the micro bit and kind of spreading the word about what microbiota can do and the impact we can have when we work together as an ecosystem so i i thought this year it would be really nice as well as giving you an update about what we're working on in microbit to give a bit of perspective um about how we see our role so we're going to talk first a little bit about um technology and magic and why we think that distinction uh is important then i'm going to talk a bit about some of the things we've been working on so data logging a new micro bit python editor that's currently in alpha and will be launched next year micro bit v2 0.2 so the 2.2 is very small there and then just a bit of uh you know not not what we're actually working on but some things that we're thinking about so what's coming in the future who are we collaborating with and last but perhaps most importantly an invitation to come and collaborate with us on all of this discovery working out how we can make microbit even more effective even more fun even better so technology and magic what am i going on about so i think a lot of you will have seen this quote before it's very popular uh in the technology world any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and it's often used as a justification for why technology should feel and be magic and that's great actually you know magic can make complicated things look simple magic can be really fun magic is often intriguing you get drawn in you want to know what's going on and it it does engage people you know we we might all have the experience of being kind of drawn in by a magic trick and encouraged to to find out more but magic does also have some dark sides and i'm not talking about black magic i'm talking about sometimes the way you can feel uh at the behest of magic so magic is not under your control magic in many ways is not meant to be understood and it's not an empowering experience to be involved in a magic trick um magic is a trick and and i like to use this phrase magic is inscrutable by its definition it's it's hard to understand so if technology is like magic um and advanced technology feels like magic what impact does that have for our mission to inspire every child to create their best digital future and actually as we look at those dark sides of magic we can see that there can be some really significant impact to technology feeling magic if technology feels inscrutable if it feels like a trick like you're not supposed to see behind the curtain well maybe you're not going to be inspired maybe you're not going to get involved maybe you're not going to feel empowered to start creating with technology so i think one very important role that we have in the tech team and the foundation as a whole is to think extremely carefully about how and when technology should feel magical and it means that we're constantly thinking about this balance between two things on one hand we want to present simple analogs of the complex magical technology that students see around them that help them understand them and expose what's going on but actually we also want to take those good sides of the magic and technology we really want to make sure that people do have a magical playful intriguing engaging experience using the micro bit so we want to take that kind of magical technology bit where everything just seems perfect and smooth and brilliant and use it to actually help expose what technology is so i'm going to give you a really specific example that i've used for a long time in the micro bit to explain why i think the micro bit is an effective learning tool and it is the analogy between a micro bit and a mobile phone so apologies if you've seen me present a slide like this before but the micro bit is in many ways the simplest analogy you could present to a mobile phone it's got a screen albeit a much simpler one it's got some buttons it's got wireless communication between other devices and it runs apps the programs you put on your micro bit so by being a very simple understandable controllable analog to a mobile phone we help expose that magic we help kind of open the curtain and show people behind the scenes of what's going on in a mobile phone and taking this to another level of detail let's look at the micro bit display at a technical level that micro bit display is a bunch of leds wide in a grid and actually it's important that we don't just you know when we're trying to expose this magic we don't just throw that straight into students faces and say go on turn turn the right pixels on and off off you go you know with the raw electronics we actually create this higher level abstraction we say yeah you can turn each led on and off but we do a lot of work in the background to present that effective analog so so much of what we're doing is working out how to get that balance right likewise we don't make students uh you know constantly check the value on a pin to see whether a button is being pressed or not we give them an event that can tell when the button has been pressed but by by kind of exposing these simple analogs to technology we make it easy to understand and we make it less magical but in order to do that we have to do a lot of stuff behind the scenes to give this simple kind of clear experience so i thought i'd just kind of split that down into some examples we've got the led led display which is a really nice way of showing what a screen does we've got block based programming which gives you a really simple introduction to logic flow control kind of it's very clear but you do understand how computers make decisions things like if statements things like loops an on loud block is a really nice simple example of what a smart speaker is doing when it's listening and radio messages you know we don't expose wifi on microbit we don't actually typically you know gives you direct control of bluetooth straight away but we do provide a nice simple example of how radio messages are sent and received but then on the kind of magical side we and our partners microsoft as well present these incredible web-based editors that do so much just in the browser there's a lot of magic going on there the micro bit drive itself is a bit of tech magic um the built-in sensors you know actually in a micro bit motion sensor to detect that shake you've got a really tiny physically moving thing inside a chip you know that that's totally mind-blowing magic um that's going on in order to enable this and the simulator and the universal hex for micro bit v1 and v2 to work kind of seamlessly together so this is what we're always doing in the tech team is trying to think how can we present really understandable clear examples of technology and what do we have to do behind the scenes to make that happen so now we can move on then to what we've been doing in that area recently and i'm going to start with i'm looking at that micro bit usb drive so i think you all know that the micro bit is a usb drive you plug it into your computer um it shows up as a micro bit drive and you can program it by dragging and dropping code onto the micro bit drive brilliant but often people then ask well if the micro bit is a usb drive why can't i copy things off it as well why can't i log some data on my micro bit and just copy that straight off onto my computer and that's a good example of where you know the magic breaks down so with micro bit v2 we've just been doing work in the last year to make that possible so now you can get data off your micro bit by reading it off that micro bit drive so the steps to do that look like this first you have to write your program in mate code or micropython and you need to use these new log features which are available as beta features at the moment then you put that program on your micro bit you go and log your data however you want however your program has told you to log the data then you plug the micro back into your computer and you open this new file on your microbit drive called mydata.htm and it's sitting there right there alongside the details and the microbit drive so here's the my data file let's just uh kind of simulate opening that up let's open that up and inside this file you can download you get a csv if you download this so just your data as a csv you can copy the data out you can get a visual preview of your data and all of that happens just by double clicking on the my data file that's on your micro bit drive so i'm going to switch to a quick live demo now of doing this so hopefully you can see my browser here um and we're going to create a new program so i'm going to go back to make code create a new project here and i'm going to call this data logging and uh the way to access this data logging currently is via an extension it's called data logger if we put the data logger extension into our program here we've got a new set of blocks data logger and we've got a new a lovely simple log data block we've got another few that we're going to look at later you can respond to the log being full you can delete your log um you can set your timestamp but we can take log data um and let's do that for start only when we push button a so on button a pressed we're going to log some data and i'm going to log some x values and some y values and the actual data i'm going to log is going to be from the accelerometer the acceleration data of my micro bit so acceleration x and i'm also going to log acceleration y so here's a super simple program now that's going to log x and y values on my micro bit so i can download that copy it onto my micro bit in the interest of time i'm i'm actually going to instead show you a program that i wrote earlier um this one here so that does a bit more exciting logging it logs x y and z values and it uses this new every block so we've got in the loops category every every 50 milliseconds i'm going to log some x y and z values um and i've been doing that on this microbit that you've got here and log into my computer so if i look on my micro bit drive i've got a mydata.html file and if i just open that in this browser window here you can see i've got all of my data um and i can have the visual preview this here is when i tapped uh the microbit against the desk so you can see i maxed out the accelerometer data now the other thing that's really exciting alongside these data logging blocks is we've also added um you know if you want to log data over a very short period of time that's great but if you want to log data over a long period of time you might not want the micro bits battery to run out so we're also working and these are still in beta so you'll find them here um on github i'll we'll uh send some links in the chat afterwards but if you add the the new micro bit power extension into make code so i can just take that url add it and this obviously when we launch these they'll be much easier to access they'll be in this list but you've also got some power saving blocks that allows microbit to enter low power mode so you can set which buttons will put you into full power um and you can request low power mode which puts the microphone into a very low power sleep so that's our work on data logging and um i think one really important thing to think about with data logging is that we think that data logging is a really important part of exposing the magic of uh exposing the magics and switch back to my slides of ai and ml actually so you know we we set out with microbite v2 to help make ai and ml clearer for students and one of the things you know this is this is a picture that uh katie sent me as an example of um one of the steps people get wrong when trying to do a ai and ml we skip all these foundational steps and we think data science is actually also a really important foundational scent step in ai and ml so we think this is a really key part of teaching that ai curriculum is to know how you collect data how you clean data how you analyze it great so that's data logging let's look now also at a new microbit python editor we've been working on and i want to start on this by saying thanks to a bunch of the people that we've been working on this with so you might have seen the talk yesterday by babas and pierre about frame based editing work they're doing at kcl it's been a fantastic collaboration for us to learn about python also the micropython team university of oxford have contributed with some of their students and arm as well have contributed a lot to this work through graduate rotations in the foundation so here is our new python editor this is what it looks like we've got a sidebar on the left you've got your code on the right and we've got this code structure highlighting so you can clearly see kind of uh more clearly where you are in your code and help understand indentation and if i just switch to my browser now you can see this working live um what we've got here is an easy way to navigate and explore the features of the microwave so if i click on this explorer i can look at loops variables logic to display so imagine i want to know how to just put an led uh some scroll some text on the screen or maybe show an image a heart image um i can have a look at some of the images so i've got a happy image and that tells me how to do it and now i can insert this code into my program so we're this is absolutely still alpha work we're still working on exactly what this looks like where the code goes how the code gets inserted can you drag it but we wanted to show it to you now and encourage people to start using it and there's one thing i'd really like to show you in this editor it's this feedback button so here there's a feedback button where you can provide any kind of feedback you like about the editor and we really encourage you to open the new python editor have a play with it and just tell us does it work for you who do you want to use the python editor with you know what stumbling blocks did you come across what ideas have you got to improve it so um feedback is really important to us at this stage the other thing i kind of wanted to show is that we've worked really hard on making uh auto complete feature here instead of so if i start typing um if i start typing you start to get completion information about the features of the microbit um including documentation and a way to actually take me to see that documentation in the sidebar so display scroll and i can also get some help about how i want to do this and i also i'm told if i haven't completed my function i've got errors as well and if i even now if i connect to my micro bit and run this on my micro bit um we can see i've now got uh the serial connection so i can have a look at the program on my micro bit if i flash this to my micro bit now it's going to flash my program onto my micro bit directly and uh if i get an error actually rather than having to read the error off the screen in my micro bit i'm told exactly where the line uh pro line in my program is that's caused the error and what kind of error it is so that should help make life a lot easier for students using python um on their machines to kind of find what's going wrong when they when they have their programs so we're really excited actually about how this is gonna make the process of teaching python a little bit smoother so having shown you the editor now i think i'd also like to talk a little bit about you know what's going on behind the scenes here and and what we're aiming to achieve and actually coming back to our magic analogy one of the things we wanted to do was to show behind the curtain a bit more of of writing code so block based editors are fantastic because they stop you making certain kinds of mistakes they stop you making typos they stop you making syntax errors they stop you making incomplete function calls but it's really important if you want to learn about coding to eventually learn about all of those things so for this editor we want to make something that supports people in educational context we want to make learning python easier more fun more approachable and therefore we hope have an impact on the diversity of people excited by text-based coding we thought it was really important to be able to discover the features of microbit one thing that block based editors do really well is that you kind of browse what you can do on the device so we've worked on that but it is not a block editor it's very specifically designed for text-based coding because we think the only way to learn about syntax errors code code errors logic indentation is by actually to expose students to those problems but in a constructive supportive way rather than a way that makes people feel confused and frustrated and like they don't understand so that's a really important thing for us for this editor we've also made a number of important developer focus changes so we wanted to bring the python editor onto a modern tech stack to make it easier for a wide community to contribute to but we also are building it in a modular way that means anyone else building exciting micro python editors for the micropipette can take what we've done and use it in their editor so be there edgy blocks or kcl or someone else building a micropython editor like therian apps we want to do you know key plumbing so that all of you that are building editors can can benefit and kind of stand on our shoulders there as well right and then just to clarify the audience for this we're aiming at children in secondary schools ages 12 and above at the moment and as we go through this alpha process that we're going through now we're going to be doing some user research on you know really understanding prior knowledge required using the editor how how how kind of far back can we push it it's going to work on tablet but not mobile phone because we think text-based coding really needs a keyboard and we do want people to be able to achieve advanced tasks with it and use libraries and um and modules so i think i've made this clear already but it is absolutely we're in alpha right now very early stages there's lots still to do we're looking at search how you can insert code user research and feedback we want to make the errors even clearer with translations and then we're we're really interested in hearing people's views on simulation once you connect your microbit over web usb you've got a really smooth experience quick turnaround fast errors and we'd like to understand of the people that think they want to use this editor in that audience is simulation important how would you use the simulator in a lesson in a classroom environment what would you use it for what do you think you'd be able to do with this editor if you had a simulator um versus if you didn't and we'd love you just to use the feedback form on the editor if you've got thoughts about um how and when a simulator would fit in this so we're going through alpha now we'll we'll go into beta uh early next year and the target currently is to release it in july 2022 and to leave the existing editor as it stands available for at least a year for everyone to use you know if you've got books screenshots things that focus on that old user experience we're not taking that away we're just adding this um as the the primary editor and the other things of course is this will be done we're not going to launch as if it's not ready so there's while we're at such an early stage in the project there's there's lots of possibilities for this to change okay so that's our python editor and we we hope that does help kind of take away some of the magic that goes on and people really understand how writing text-based coding works so on to micro bit v2 0.2 so the the goal here is to communicate that v 2.2 is just a response to a tricky problem that is affecting lots of people at the moment the silicon crunch so you'll have heard about car manufacturers you'll have heard about you know ps5s being difficult to get hold of and actually we are not immune to the problem that's going on in the whole industry right now that some parts are very difficult to come by so microbit v2 is a v2.2 so it is a small revision of the micro bit in order to resolve uh the supply problems so here's a micro bit v2 um this is a microbit v2.2 so i've got uh right i'll hold up all that one of each to my camera um they are deliberately indistinguishable from each other the main processor where the student's code runs is not changed so um users need not distinguish about whether they've got a v2 or a 2.2 there's no feature difference between the two of them so there's you know everything that a hex file that ran on a v2 run on a v2.2 what we've changed is the interface chip so the thing that provides that micro bit drive and the data logging has been replaced and we've moved exactly the same software that was running on the old interface chip onto the new interface chip so it behaves in the same way and production has begun already and we're expecting a roll out over the following months so hopefully you'll you'll should find that this makes uh keeps the micro bit manufactured and available the other thing to say is as we've moved um arm who we collaborate on this daplink software that gives that microbit drive worked with us and they've actually ported that to gcc so if you were someone who wanted to contribute if you're part of the tech community and you felt you want to contribute to that dappling software you now can do it with the free compiler tools so that hopefully should also open up a wider community around that all right so that's what we've worked on now to keep things moving what are we thinking about so we looked at um you know micro bit v2 features and we found that making sound the the playing sounds was really engaging people loved the happy excited twinkle sounds that we'd done with sound designers for the micro bit but actually they were a little bit more magic than they were kind of explaining what was going on so we've been looking you know we think that on loud sound that works really nicely as a kind of it's the right balance between magic and exposing the magic but we'd like to do a little bit more on on helping people understand how they can make these cool sounds like happy like twinkle like soaring um that people love using so we've been doing some research on some different blocks for making sounds in creative ways that can kind of go you know make little chirps warbles clicks and and and help people create those micro bit sounds so we'll expect some testing work and some beta programs about that later in the year uh also next year we also wanted to show you if you didn't see the talk on it um the frame based editing work done by kcl looking at how you could make a frame based editing to help the blocks the text transition and if you're interested in that i suggest you watch the video of the the talk was in microbit live yesterday and actually we had some students at oxford looking at whether you can recognize uh the sound the sound emoji or the microbit sounds on another micro bit so send messages over sound or can you send morse code so we did some you know some interesting research on that and i think we'll be looking at how we can take that research and kind of underpinning prototypes and bring that through into the um the micro bit editors and also you know understanding how that's going to work in a classroom in an educational context where you know where it sits on that balance between magic and exposing the magic and then there's also a talk on this editor in microbit live this is some work also done with an undergraduate group at oxford uh lorna's talking about this i think in the in the evening session today or even in uk time looking at um kind of debug how we can do how we can help and expose how we kind of talk students through the errors and it was based on this idea that in programming often what what you need if you've got a problem is just to explain the problem to a rubber duck and if you explain the problem to a rubber duck just in the process of explaining what's wrong you'll realize the solution and ah that's it is a perfect button to see on this uh on this editor because commonly just trying to explain what your problem is is acceptable solving so we were interested in doing some research around whether there are ways in the user interface in editors that we can do to encourage students to think through and explain the errors and break them down so that was also a really interesting kind of piece of research and collaboration and this is just the tip of the iceberg of the kind of projects that are going on around the world i'm aware there's stuff going on everywhere and i'm kind of learning about microbit but i thought i'd just expose some of the the work to encourage everyone here to think about micro bit not just as something which is done and finished but as a platform that is always evolving and always learning new skills and and always thinking about how we can use the capabilities of the micro device to make teaching easier to make technology clearer to give students a greater mastery of what they can do with technology because that i think is fundamentally important to why the microbit exists and how we're going to help empower students to change the world with it so finally then we would like you to come and help us with this so the first thing you can do if you're interested in anything that i've talked about today and you're thinking well where will i find that how will i know when it's time to test it join our beta testing program so microbit.org forward slash testing so if we just have a quick look there and go microbit.org forward slash type property forward slash testing see our beta program there and you can sign up as a beta tester and that will give you an example of all the things that are currently in beta and you can have a go at testing those and giving us feedback i showed you already the feedback button in the python editor no amount of feedback is too small we want to hear everything all your thoughts all your ideas um and maybe you want to do a university project with us maybe you want to do your phd on microbit um we really love collaborating with educators technologists who are really grappling with the problems of how we can make microbes the easiest and most effective learning tool so if you think that sounds interesting or you're kind of you're doing work adjacent to that or you know an affiliated university get in touch you can either try help microbid.org you can try me i'm johnny at microbit.org um and just reach out and say we're interested in collaborating here and then all of the microbit foundation's code is open source on github so you can check out um the microbit foundation github and have a look at our projects there including the python editor and we are working we're working in the open with the python editor there so if we have a look at um let's just have a quick look at github for microbit foundation on forward slash microbit all right so here's our python editor next you can see all of the work that we're doing if you want to take a look behind the curtain of what we're doing here's a bunch of our work that kind of work we're working on so you can come and get involved and comment on issues and tell us more about um what what you think about the editor there so to summarize there's real value to making a magical smooth technological experience and we think that's a super important part of microbit you know when you plug it in it just works and students have their first experience of the micro bit is success enjoyment happiness but we think it's really important that that magic doesn't get in the way of understanding and exposing what technology does and giving students a mastery of technology so we want as you're thinking perhaps about how you teach with the microbit as well think about that balance how can we expose and explain uh technology while giving people a creative fun magical experience there'll be a lot more kind of on that problem in the final session of microbit live which starts in almost exactly two hours from now so go and have some food go for a run do some yoga do something have a break and then come back for um that session our opening keynotes dr kate maloney i'll be introducing that in almost exactly two hours thank you very much for everyone that's contributed to today be that by contributing listening to talks and commenting on them or presenting something it's an absolutely fantastic chance to understand all the incredible things people are doing with microbit and we're so grateful that you're all here thank you very much
