excellent um well this radio code game is based on this game guess who that i've played with my daughter and so um basically what it is is students make a simple code using the make code website students are paired randomly and anonymously and then they answer yes no questions by pressing their but the a and b buttons on their micro bit um so every student needs a micro bit and then index cards with two sets of numbers enough for your class so if you have 18 students you need two sets of cards numbered one through nine and then you need two to three sets of yes no questions and the code isn't super hard it's just button a sends the string yes button b since the string no a plus b sends their name and i guarantee that at least one student will type in y-o-u-r-n-a-m-e instead of their name and then you need the on radio received receive stream code block making sure that receive string is dragged down to cover the word hello so that um the word yes no or their name will show up so i pass out a card to each student and it pairs them randomly with another student they put that number right here where it says radio set group number so two people will have number one two people will have number two but they don't know who has that number um then i have the students test and troubleshoot i have them tested on their simulator to make sure it's sending the yes and no code um i make sure that you know the code is correct and then i start asking questions after we have troubleshooted so questions might be things like are you wearing glasses this year do you have on a disposable mask is your hair long enough for a ponytail and as they're answering their questions they're pushing button a to send their answer to another student and they're looking at their micro bit to see what their secret partner is saying yes or no to these questions and then at the end they are trying to guess who their partner was and i have kids some classes absolutely love this and we'll play you know through four or five rounds within one class period and then some classes we're just troubleshooting the whole time because um they can't figure out um the code or there's just little mistakes that are made this is the code right here again radio set group and that number is the number that's on their card sending yes sending no sending their name and then on radio receive receive string um so let me come back to the chat and i'll stop sharing um i have a link that's the google slide stock that i unsuccessfully presented i just went through it really fast but that um there are directions in that that might be helpful if you want to do this with your class that's totally different okay awesome i actually did it this week with my students and and four of the six classes had a blast two of them struggled a little bit but most of them had a blast with it
