thanks hi everybody i'm kristen burress i'm going to go ahead and share my screen and make sure that i share the right one and um these slides this is what i have um linked in um the chat so a lot of these um a lot of i've put a lot of links to other things i think one of the one of the skills i have because i'm not terribly original is that i curate other people's sources pretty well and so a lot of these ideas come from other folks and then they've been remixed or remashed in some way so i'm going to mostly be talking about adding micro bits originally it was to analog but i realized a lot of our projects have a little digital component being in a fab lab um so we're gonna kind of talk about that um both ways so this is just a little bit about where i work um i feel like i'm the luckiest person on the planet because i work at the global center for digital innovation and we are a k-14 educational fab lab which means we're sitting on a community college campus but we do have kindergarten through 12th grade public school kids have access we touch a high school called stem school chattanooga so a lot of the pictures of students that you'll see have stem on their shirt and that's actually who who my boss is is the stem school principal which is great um we get to do a lot of professional development so in this slide the top uh the top left picture are um teachers learning about micro bits so that then they can take them back to their um k12 classrooms and then we also have students coming in and doing work um in the lab either independently or through a content class um so we're kind of talking about analog prototyping as you move towards digital prototyping so um when we when we ask kids to innovate um we as we go through the design process we're talking about um getting kids to brainstorm on paper first usually sketches and then move into an analog prototyping phase it's easy to iterate cardboard and straws and tape and glue because they can abandon ideas that they consider a bad idea in other words they're not married to the stuff if it messes up if it doesn't work they can crumple it up and they can start over or recycle it we hope if it's cardboard and then also the analog prototyping gives folks a chance to be highly creative you can get the point across very quickly as students move towards digital prototyping what we're talking about is using laser cutters and engravers 3d printers cnc routers and anything that takes a computer to design so digital prototyping is really just computer designed prototyping so if you look at our innovation sweet spot with desirability viability and feasibility the digital prototyping is a little bit higher fidelity it's more precise the kids can be very specific about sizes you know if you've ever cut cardboard with scissors it's not too precise ever and so that's why we try to get them to move into digital prototyping as well but they have to start with analog and what we do for analog prototyping is we have lots of wonderful helpful tools in fact i brought this one home this is probably my favorite tool um it's called a canary cutter i don't know if that's a brand name it must be a brand but basically it's a tiny little saw that cuts cardboard very well and it's it's it's a little sharp but it would take a lot for a student to hurt themselves on this i also am a huge fan of the cropidils if anyone is a scrapbooker you may have seen crocodiles the best thing in the world is that they have these two hole punch sizes and what we've found is that they can hole punch through popsicle sticks and then you can add nuts like the 3m nuts and bolts fit perfectly through them little paper brads straws craft sticks skewers whatever it is the crocodile makes a perfect hole it's a smaller hole than a paper punch and it's a lot stronger than a paper punch and then in my bottom corner is another favorite tool the kids just love it and that's a cardboard cutter or a zip snip is what some folks call them those are super fun and really change the game for cutting cardboard in fact my younger students i feel safer with them using these electric tools than trying to deal with sharp scissors like i've given out two band-aids this year one was a hot glue gun and one with scissors and no band-aids for any of the other tools that you would think would be more dangerous which leads us to safety um and so in fact by the way yesterday i got to see stu lowe if you'll notice his little icon in the upper right hand corner of two of these safety posts or three of these safety posters like i said i curate other people's amazing ideas so thanks to stu for publishing these little safety boxes um on his website as well and if you don't follow him i highly suggest it um but we do have to keep safety in mind whenever kids are using things the box cutters and the x-acto knives those are my least favorite um tool probably for cardboard but sometimes it's necessary i definitely recommend getting students to wear gloves especially when they're off hand i bought cut resistant gloves because sometimes they get a little too close to their other hand well you know kids are kids so definitely think about safety um i also publish not publish but made this board based on other people's great ideas of teaching kids how to fold um cardboard because you can do so much more and strengthen cardboard by folding it in special ways than you can by cutting it and gluing the heck out of it um hot glue is not the strongest support system in the world so it's really nice to have to have a uh like a like a way for kids to get strength that aren't actually um you know just about glue and then here's something that we forget when we talk about micro bit i love the micro bit in all ways but 3.3 volts is not terrific if you're adding led lights or if you're adding servos so i highly highly recommend if you're going to get kids to add micro bits to analog prototypes they usually want things to move blink or make sound the sound is great for 3.3 volts but if you need more than that you're gonna need some sort of an additional power source i have examples of these are just three i've seen it doesn't mean they're the only ones that are awesome um it just happens to be the ones that i've had experience with but the adafruit cricket um for micro bit does work best if you have a um plug and oh mine's plugged in right now so i can't show you but like the award where you literally plug it in you can kind of see in the picture that it does have a jack in the back um but i have found no matter how many batteries i add to it it still is unhappy until i literally plug it in um and it's a 5 volt plug um the ring bit expansion board in the middle is the simplest because it just has batteries on the back um in fact i have one right here i don't know if you can see it or not but it takes three double a batteries and it's all connected and it's super easy for students um to deal with um i do recommend though take the batteries out when you're storing them so uh they don't corrode in the in the back and then the kittenbot is also has a plug and it works really well um if you plug it in um to like a nine volt plug um there's so many others it's just ridiculous but find what you need don't pay a ton i will say the ring bit is about six to seven dollars it's probably the cheapest one on this page and it will do 99.9 of everything i need my students to do so i do recommend that um so this is uh a couple of examples i'm gonna just sort of play this but um the one thing i want to point out i don't know if you guys can see my cursor i don't think so yes you can so these are the little 3m bolts and popsicle sticks and so i wound up um this was cut with the crop-a-dile and then connecting the cardboard feet um to the popsicle stick and then again the popsicle to the servo um can be done really nicely with those crocodiles if you've never gone online and see the microbit virtual parade i greatly uh recommend it i'm just going to play a minute of it because it's super fun oops maybe i'm not [Music] like sorry um by the way i do recommend look that up it's super fun these um this was a virtual parade sort of a design contest from the summer when everybody was stuck at home with kovid and so these were a lot of fun to play with um some other examples of design challenges um i love games and pinball games especially and so um you can see that this is an instructable here on the left and i gotta be honest i haven't done it yet but it looks really great where you use conductive tape um and then a um like a steel ball as it rolls over parts of your game it would trigger uh responses and then the pinball machine is here oh [Music] uh [Music] so that was um made a couple years ago with the v1 micro bit and that's why the speaker was attached but it made it very dramatic when you lost the game if you kept score if you lost five balls then you know the imperial march came um so a project that i've done with students actually we're working on it this week so i don't have any completed projects um is art one kinetic sculptures um so i get to um connect with content teachers and they bring their students to the lab and come for a week or two weeks and and work on projects so what our kids are making here are kinetic sculptures that i believe have an environmental focus and the kids started designing these amazing projects out of paper and came up with great ideas but they need to be kinetic and what we found out that we didn't really know is that kids have no idea how mechanics work um so we had to take a time out in the middle of the project and do a little paper mech if you've never been to paper mech i believe it's dot org it's on the next slide um it is amazingly helpful uh to teach kids how to do a rack and pinion gears a crank etc um the group in the top right corner wanted to make some sort of a kudzu uh chopping blade action but then they realized they didn't know how to use servos so that's kind of where we we got with this but um here is one of the students um ah thank you for the for the it's papermec.net i always get stuff like that wrong once started it makes a zero button a goes up to 150 degrees but in b it is down and it goes back to the rotation step zero and the touch center goes to so that was a student group um using a rack and pinion they also had no idea what those words meant but you know it's all learning process and then here's the same group playing with a crank and um so the difference there if you've never looked at different servos is you can get 180 degree servo which is the group on the left or a continuous servo which is the group on the right and um but both projects worked really well you may notice that they did laser cut the um little pieces of cardboard and um and plywood it there i don't know anyone who can cut out a gear correctly so if you do have access to some some pre-cut parts that would be terrific um oh and here here's the link for papermac.net um it is just truly amazing so if you need any inspiration please go there um here's a senior group and she's not crazy it was halloween and we celebrate halloween at school so she's dressed as a bear but she's also making a bear and so they have an entrepreneurship project and they've named it inventanooga we're in chattanooga tennessee so it's in vintanuga um and they do a pitch contest and so basically she took apart this build-a-bear which was a little disturbing at the time and um and sewed in the micro bit and you'll also see the buttons on his hands and feet and so the buttons are a way for a child to uh tell people how they're feeling and so one button is happy and it blinks sort of happy um lights and then another one is i'm feeling angry and another one is i'm feeling frustrated so anyway so that's their their pitch is that that would work for children with autism that they could help share how they're feeling um we've done another project with making music and these are pretty awesome um these were a few of the the ones that include music this first one has no sound that is super sad but that was supposed to be the um what is it called the uh last unicorn song singing [Music] instead of using uh [Music] and this one's just a noisemaker every time the ball goes across the aluminum foil it makes a different sound it also instigates a servo so it tilts back and forth as it moves around [Music] so one and one is sound [Music] nice so um i've been doing um analog projects with students for a really long time and taught seventh grade forever and so i included these pictures because i truly truly wish that i had had a um a micro bit at the time and um like for instance when they made rube goldberg machines which is the bottom left i i imagine a micro bit could have been used to start the marble at the top it could have been used to keep score if it made it to the bottom uh the windmills could have actually turned with a continuous servo and then um the bottom right one is they had to look up maybe not endangered animals but different species in different climates and it would have been super cool if his little wings had moved and those are still amazing projects the kids did really great but i really wish i'd found microbits even a little bit earlier um so the question was do i do i leave these projects out for others to see and interact with if students let me keep them i will put them on display i do have a display in my classroom uh what i found is that most times if they make something they love they won't give it back and so um but if if they do give it back yes i would love i do have them out the pinball machine lasted for about two years before it completely got destroyed um and so it is no longer out but some of the other projects are like i believe the bear is going to get to stay in my classroom here's another project that i did with seventh grade um they had to build an earthquake resistant building um and the the analog part of this is i don't know if you can see the shake table at the bottom but there's this giant drill and uh yoga or exercise um rubber bands holding it all together and the table just super shakes and so they had to create something that would um survive an earthquake and i really really wish we'd had a micro bit because it'd be fun to use the accelerometer i wish i could stop doing that here we go [Applause] [Music] um but that would have been really great to see if we could have created different earthquakes at different magnitudes maybe using the accelerometer in some way that would have been super cool um here's uh just an example of of a few of the design thinking processes that i use with students uh the first one that just says the challenge um that's just a quick prototyping um like brainstorming session where they get feedback after each iteration so the idea is that you start with your problem you define it and then you draw a picture or explain your first iteration give it to somebody else get feedback then make changes design again and then finally on your third iteration that's the one you're going to begin prototyping i find that kids really can hold on to that first idea without some um without some feedback and their peers can usually provide really good feedback but i sometimes have to really push their thinking um to get them to try something a little more challenging than maybe their first idea um so here are some of the resources that uh were in the presentation i got to be real honest i don't know how i'm doing on time but i think that is the end of my presentation so i would love it if folks had more questions um and just to see if anyone has any comments or any any questions that they'd like to add kristen you actually have up until uh 2 40 and the resources are are amazing and i think you are wanting to [Music] share more ideas are open for some questioning i love the engineering mindset the analog i think you've given a lot of people things to think about i was just going to post a hacking stem resource that connects earthquakes to excel and really uses that micro bit or an address we have but just a great opportunity to think in analog mindset as you're presenting but you do have more time so oh yeah that's great i was so worried i was gonna i talked too fast i guess sorry everybody um but i do want to share a couple of little things um another of the micro bit challenges i know that dustin um shared the um the virtual parade but microbit also sponsored a um olympics uh themed contest this summer and this is one of the things that were made for that and by the way it is connected to this little ring bit so um i know you can't see anything on my table but it does roll if i press a it goes one direction if i press b which is very challenging it goes the other way and then if i hit the um touch sensor whoops hang on i'm failing uh the touch sensor it will actually row and all this is is um simply crop a dials uh holding or i made holes with little crocodiles and put those little um bolts through and it's connected to one servo well there's actually two servos in there there's um ones for the wheels and for the um for the little oars i guess for lack of a better word um and then hopefully you guys have maybe seen the tickle bot this is the um other expansion board example that i have and so this is the kittenbot i believe that's super fun i love them one of the things that's really great is this external power switch and that's on the ring bit it's actually on all of them but um this is my version and it's not a very good one of the tickle bot but when you press the little thing it giggles and moves his little feet but um anyway so that's an example of one two um but the kids love i mean i've i don't teach coding i teach problem-based learning and so what i have really noticed is that kids love to make things that blink make sound and move and so spending some time finding servos and and getting these little expansion boards has really just changed everything um with with with how they interact with coding a lot of kids don't walk into my classroom and i say hey you could connect a micro bit to that you could code it they immediately go oh i don't know if i want to code because they're not thinking about coding something that does something and that's one of the reasons that micro i'm a super big fan of microbit is because the kids get to make something that is important to them and something that they're really interested in and they'll learn to code to do what they want it to do and they'll problem solve for that as well um gosh are there any other questions you guys are kind of quiet out there in the chat well thanks i'll wait for to see if anyone has any messages um john is complementing your approach um when you when you think about um the lesson design in your entry and you're considering some of the curriculum or classroom applications where do you start from a mindset perspective gosh well when i when i'm first working with teachers the first thing we do is start with their standards right because if they're going to spend time on a project it better move the kids forward with a standard and um you know even even pbs that have nothing to do with micro bit that's that's really where we have to start and so i i my advice to teachers is to look through the standards that you are bored with yourself and um that you don't necessarily enjoy teaching and see if you can ramp those up and make those as engaging as you know some of the others because not every standard lends itself to making right to a maker project or a coding project surprisingly social studies and language arts teachers it really is is in some ways easier to connect those than to some science standards i was a science teacher for 18 years um seventh grade through seniors and there's a lot of really cool activities that science can do i'm not saying there's not good micro bit activities like like the soil um figuring out when to water your plants like there's so many really cool activities but there's also other things that teachers already have access to but what's really great is turning a story into life um figuring out how to visualize an event in history using the micro bit or creating some sort of animatronics puppetry um or a play of some sort you know so those are the things that i i find a lot of fun because you because then the kids remember those standards as as much as they do the ones that that were maybe more engaging to begin with that's awesome and the language around analog because i might be new to a lot and for some of us we take for granted that mindset our approach how do you approach that with maybe an audience that might it might be brand new for and just to even comment around that in your yes we i don't think i ever used the word analog before i knew what digital prototyping might be right so it was it was kind of a word that i started using to compare it to when you digitally make something when you make something with a cnc router when you make something with a 3d printer we did we didn't want to just call it the crafty prototype but that's kind of what it is it's you know using those things that you have in the room the string the tape the glue um the cardboard and so um it and i guess i don't know i guess it just came from clocks like an analog clock versus a digital clock i if there's someone out there that coined the term i'm sorry i can't give you the correct credit i don't know who you are that that might lead us to the fabrication and some of the things around your passions and interests and some of the the uncoverings of your bio and your passion projects right now and maybe if you can speak to vision and where those opportunities are leading for yourself professionally but then also what the outcomes might need for those people that you're serving right well i one of the things that i i can't stop playing with right now is um we have a digital embroidery machine and so we've been doing a lot of turtle stitch if you've never played with turtle stitch go to turtle stitch um and kids can code their um code what they want their embroidery to look like so i i have some students the ones that in the picture that were making the crank they actually are wanting to make the crank be flippers for a turtle and so if you can picture someday it will be connected and it will have little flippers that go like this so anyway so their next step is they're gonna learn how to analog sew right they're gonna do some sewing with just stitching and then they're probably gonna add some um embroidery that has been coated as well um and so i i just love projects where i don't tell kids you have to use this machine or you have to use this you know type of code and they can dream something and then i help them figure out how to meet that goal right so um they can use any of the machines they can make it out of felt they can do whatever they want to do and then um and you know we'll just i'll learn right along with them because i don't know that's so amazing and i'm paying attention to the chat they're not seeing any questions yet but please we have a few more minutes to ask questions um one of the things doesn't ask is um you shared your experience with different age groups you shared some projects that you started to hit that if i only had the micro bed and just if you could speak specifically to your reflections on some of those projects where it could fit in and where the true value is for you and your practice when it comes to microbial technology aligned to the approaches and offerings for learning opportunities that you're building and designing for your and offering your students right i would say you know the one of the best on-ramps for microbit would be sound um because even if you have a classroom set of v-ones which we still do and i use them all the time is um it was i was just in another session and they had a link for hacking the headphones so that you can connect your micro bit uh v1 to headphones and the kids and it's a little less cacophonous by the way in your classroom if they're listening to 100 or 14 different micro bits um with headphones it'll make your life a little better but anyway uh but but definitely adding sound and getting kids to um you know even play a game it could be a review for a test and you could have kids with if they have the right answer they could send answers through radio signal um and if they get the right answer maybe they get a buzz back or a different type of buzz for for an answer or something like that but um but definitely music and sounds if you if you don't want if you're not ready to invest in servos and extension boards um they love it they love the sound from a student perspective if you had this story tell somebody your examples were maybe moments that you've engaged students that maybe might not have had learning opportunities presented to them in the past before something like this or just generally if you can just um my my student you saw in the pictures dressed like tigger she's a senior and she had never coded i don't know how well i do i mean a lot of students are not necessarily drawn to it they don't look for classes that might include coding and she had never ever coded anything before and i have never seen someone more proud of connecting buttons she soldered for the first time um oh actually we we decided not to solder we used the pins instead but anyway she still connected a circuit for maybe the first time and um and and made that bear interactive and um her and her two partners uh were just over the moon with with learning to code and i remember her saying you know this is fun and this is easy i can do this and and i didn't expect to hear um you know if you've ever done a project with students right they start and they're like i have a great idea and then they start and things don't go well and they're like oh it's terrible terrible idea and if things don't go well then they're like oh i'm terrible and you're like no no get out of the pit and so then it goes back up again on the other side where they're like it was a good idea and it finally worked and it's just really nice to um see kids succeed because i'm not going to do it for them but i will support them so that they get gained that confidence that's great um we are coming to a close so any closing remarks would be uh would be great and again just encouraging i know from what i can review here that um those have joined us really appreciated the exemplars and the sharing and and all the different um examples that you've offered um some of them are still digesting that as you make connections to either the physical components that are helping you leverage some of those fabric fabrication type tools there's been great comments around that and then some of the resources but any closing remarks would be fantastic we will close out this session at 2 40. sure i just um you know eastern everywhere um don't be intimidated by having to do it all at the beginning i mean a simple set of canary cutters is not very expensive if you're on a budget for your class and it really changes the struggle factor with cutting cardboard because kids can follow a pattern with this it it turns quite nicely um i also really um i mean i was a biology major i didn't know anything about coding so don't be intimidated and you don't actually have to have all the answers you just have to know how to find the right tutorials for your students what was the question how do expectations are too high compared to the tools you have available yes by the way um thank you for mentioning that um that the student with the bear they wanted it to light up potentially move do a hundred things and i was like well you'd need a micro bit for each of your different programs and so it's kind of about paring it down um so that they get one if they can use them you know because the microbit only has one program at a time so if they can find success with one and then maybe they could pair with another group if they wanted it to do something else but i really haven't found as long as it's one program much that they can't do with the micro bit with a little bit of help i mean it also depends on what you know sensors you have and things like that but um i i haven't had many disappointed kids with their project at the end um but you sometimes have to talk them off the ledge thanks everybody
