well i'm so happy to be here from and you see all my crowds because i'm originally a crafts teacher but when i finished my my education there was no work in school so i started in ict and i did it for many years and i thought if i want to have more female colleagues i have to start in education so i started teaching again and i really love it so for two days a week i teach for blind and visual impaired children and the other days i just write on my books and do workshops and especially inspire teachers and children so i will tell something about making variables because i'm a craft teacher to make that you just have to look in your closet do i have any clothes with the week i can pimp up so just get your christmas sweater or get something and get a mask or a t-shirt or a skirt or anything and just start putting for instance like a christmas light why you have christmas lights now in your house you just hack it and then you can see on the micro bit which is the plus and the minus so i hope i have it right right away no just the other way so and just attached it to your clothes then you have something already if you want to do something more i will go to i have like 10 tips for you you just can use like a normal led so you probably will have it but if you want to use it if you want to use it in a wearable you just have to turn the legs around because then your wire will be more uh more effective to it so it will touch more and if you really want to make wearables you know do a really big project then it is easy to buy those led lights which you can really integrate in your clothes for the ground you can use just such buttons so for the ground you attach those buttons to it and sometimes i use such a ring it's an iron ring and i will put it into my clothes to do it important to use also which kind of battery do i use those battery clips those battery are very easy because they got like two coins in there and they are very light of course you can do buy those batteries you can use it or a power bank or a power bank or this one which has an integrated cell battery in there so if you start making something first make a drawing that is my ground how do i do it how many circuits do i make and just draw it for you and you have to make sure that the different kind of circuits don't touch each other because if they touch each other then your circuit will not work of course you need conductive wire you can buy it in very different kind of shapes and if you use it you need of course need you need a needle and if you use it use a double thread for it use double and don't make a very long wire from it because then it will all mix up so make very small pieces of it and try it every time you do it so i'm up to number seven now two minutes uh if you have uh try it every time if you make something try if it is working that's important with the crocodile clips and then for instance here you can see in the back here you can see the different kind of circuits make sure they don't touch each other and this is my ground can you see this is my crown and then just pimp something just fun things for instance my shoes are almost famous already and if you make wearables you cannot put them in the washing machine so here's a skirt i made if i dance all the lights will go on and off so or just put something on just a simple t-shirt here is some wires i'll put it on i put it in and the light will go on enough oh no it's not working something will happen so i will put the link in the chat i put a web log especially for this talk in it so there you can see all the tips i made all the 10 tips for relying around i can make and all the drawings i made and also the link if you want to buy something but just go in your closet and start with the christmas light with your christmas sweater and you'll be fine thank you
