good morning to me here uh we are located in longmont colorado um and i want to share about what we're doing here so how do i share the slides i'm not sure how to do that the um looks like a monitor with a cross through it that's the one okay all right can you see my slides not yet oh so i did that so hang on um go here can you see the slides now we i yes we can now okay can you see now yes okay beautiful all right so i only have five minutes um so i was uh i i was able to do this project with um uh jeff bush and quentin uh biddy uh they were from uh cu uh colorado and i don't see them here so i will just um i think quintin might be online but uh i just want to quickly show you guys what we did with this so if you're here you're familiar with all the sensor stuff that you can do with the micro bit but school-wide labs from cu boulder they have taken it a step further and it created a whole entire curriculum using the sensor immersion and it's a fantastic way to take a look at it and you can see down here they've broken it beautifully from lesson one two three four five and i'll show you what we did with this and this is uh specifically targeted towards middle school but i think that with all the great sensors that we have that's available on the micro bit and also with the gator bit which is a special board we have it can definitely parlay into high school also so from the science teacher's perspective if you're into this um what it does is it combines computational thinking with project-based thinking and what you can do with this is that it works with your current curriculum and the whole idea behind this is that to help you just begin to collect and interpret data from a computer science teacher's perspective to me i think you're taking this to the next level of collecting and analyzing data but also getting kids to be problem solvers right because that's what we want to do with these tools and what i really love about this is that you're using computer as a tool for science thus computer science um so what you need is this thing called the gator bit which is a part of that and it and then the micro bit just attaches to that and it gives you additional other sensors on there on the curriculum they have a tutorial map that you can go through and each one of these if you click on it is is a beautiful integration of teaching you how to code and it's both in english and spanish so it helps students and it's just like if you're familiar with make code they go through the whole thing and you can see the progression of it like well how you start with uh lesson two and then four and it also differentiates for people who are just getting started and then for you from then for your high flyers who are gonna zip through this um and i'll show you what we did here at towards the end of learning how to use the sensors what we then did was i asked the kids what can you do what can you be how can you be problem solvers and so some of the students says hey we want to build a tool to help teachers so they created the quiet classroom some of them took the sensors and they said we we have plants at our school and so we want to help the people monitor the plants to know that they're not under watering or over watering or the co2 monitors um that you can have there a student said hey i have a hard time sleeping so we devised a little plan to help them like i think i've seen some of the tutorials on microbit where you do the two-minute breathing so we kind of integrated that with the sensors and the co2 and the temperature in his room to help him find the optimal sleeping environment for himself to help him relieve insomnia another kid another group of kids wanted to know hmm how much co2 emission is emitted during the bus loop so again these are all investigations that they did with that let me kind of show you kind of the website what i did with the website and so you can see here what they did and the actual just really researching just hands-on uh things that i think the problem solvers that they could do and i think that is it um if you have any questions let me know
