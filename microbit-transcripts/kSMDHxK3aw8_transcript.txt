uh hi everyone um i'm just gonna start off by letting everybody know i'm i'm a little bit shy so sometimes i get a little bit nervous and it's been a long time since i've been in front of the public so bear with me if i you know my pace changes a little bit i talk too fast or i stutter a little bit um but we'll get through it um okay so let's start this off so um i'm going to be focusing i'm going to be using mainly a a slide presentation today i do normally like to get hands-on and actually show and get interactive uh because that's what we love about the microbit right um but uh simply because of the subject matter that we're uh and what we're exploring today um we have some limitations because what we're going to be doing today um when you do it online uh it requires that you use your microphone or your video camera and since we're in conference uh there would be a conflict so what we're gonna see is um slides of it but i've as much as possible provided qr codes um so that later on you can go off and try this on your own um everything that you're going to see is available to the public and i think pretty much all of it is open source so you'll be able to go into it and look into it all right so a little bit about myself uh my name is phil green i'm a web service manager a developer an occasional instructor and always playing and tinkering with tech and i just love micro bits some of you might have seen some of my work before i got one of them running in the background and it's always very exciting um i work for a company called kids code jeunesse and we're a bilingual charity determined to give every canadian child access to digital skills education with a focus on girls and underserved communities uh fun fact about myself that in my first personal computer the timex sinclair 1000. um pretty old took me a whole summer to save up for it and when i started playing with the micro bit i got that same feeling when i first got this timex sinclair way back then the same sort of excitement so it was really it was really a a an exciting journey to go from that and then find myself feeling the same way that i felt when i was young and a kid and for just first getting my hands on this this personal computer so um a little fun fact there alright so let's look at teachable machine so what is teachable machine before we get started so teachable machine is a web app and it's developed uh by google and it's built on top of a tensorflow and tensorflow is basically a library to explore machine learning and artificial intelligence and what they did with teachable machine is they decided to wrap this in an easy fun accessible way it was the first version that came out which is what we're looking at here was pretty simplistic and was mainly focused on recognizing images so what you would do is you would train the system um you're training a model to recognize different types of images and then it would predict what it's looking at and you would continue training in order to get this better now what's really fun about tensorflow and teachable machines is that it really makes this accessible um in the classroom for various different reasons one is that it uses a type of technology around training and deep learning that allows us to train very rapidly training a model from scratch can take a very very long time um in the order of days not something real uh you know that's realistic to do in the classroom especially if you're you're doing a short session and you want to explore this so this is one of the advantage the other advantage is that it runs locally so when you're training it with images these images are not being sent to a server or to the cloud so to speak so everything is done locally your model is local so you don't so it does address this issue uh with kids that we're all you know always concerned about which is security and privacy it's also open source so these are wonderful things so when it first came out we saw this and we know that ai is a real big hot topic and we wanted to see if there was a way that we can bring ai into the classroom now kids coaching s focuses on young kids we're mainly elementary uh you know anywhere from grade three to grade nine we're starting to explore into the high school but we we're dealing with mostly young kids and we thought this was a good starting point so we explored it a little bit and for the most part it was interesting but we weren't able to get to the more deeper conversations around ai it just wasn't simply setting the stage properly for us or wasn't succeeding at setting the stage so that the kids can make that leap to the more deeper discussions that we can have around ai things like you know ethical use of ai or bias and all these sort of things um it and we were pondering about this we're trying to figure out like why why this might be so and how can we get around it and what we came to realize was that well one of the reasons why our microbits work so well as a tool for teaching is because when we have it in the classroom it's this inanimate object at the start and it isn't until the kid coded and get their code on it that it comes to life and that really gives a sense of ownership to our kids um when we're coding on a computer and you're on your laptop and you're doing things well you know it's not too certain how much the computer is doing for you how much of it was really a result of your coding um but with the micro bit it's very clear once you get your code onto that micro bit and it's strange because you you'll see kids look at a simple animation in a simulator and they're like oh okay but as soon as they get it on the micro bit there's this yelp of joy and i think it's really that really gives them a sense that it's their project now so that's what how this came about this project we said well how can we do this and we thought well what if we can connect teachable machines to the micro bit and so that's what we attempted to do um i did a little bit of research found a few libraries to help us and build a web app that would allow us to connect the teachable machine to the micro bit now there were a few limitations with this um one of the limitations was the original the first version of teachable machine would only allow you to actually create a couple of classes that means you could only create a couple of categories for what you're training it for so if you wanted to train it say on the alphabet you could only do i think it's three was the limit in the first one so you could only do abc so there are some limitations there there was also some limitations around the original version didn't allow you to save your model so once once you left the website and return your model was lost so there is a few limitations but we did have some success we got so one of the interesting projects we fought about was well you know um we can teach it to recognize images but can we can we you know come up with an interesting project um where you know around tech for good and we thought well sign language would be a real fun one um and it'd be really you know something really um uh suitable for uh machine learning around visuals so we tried it out and it was pretty successful we were able to teach it and again keeping in mind the limitation we were able to teach it a few letters of the alphabet and it would recognize it and then in connecting it to the micro bit we got the micro bit to display the letter that it was seeing as far as sign language now this was really interesting because right away we can kind of see the potential here um you can imagine that and and tensorflow has a tensorflow lite that can work on mobile you can imagine that you have this on your mobile and if you ever get into a situation where you have to communicate with somebody who only knows or only can communicate using sign language you can use your mobile asking permission and explaining what it does and be able to have the sign language translated for you so already the potential was there but again there's these limitations um a couple of better fun projects that we did around it we also uh had it we had our micro bit learn to read sheet music so we would cut these out into cards and we would train the teachable machine to recognize these as certain notes and then we got our micro bit to play those notes so that was a lot of fun and from there we've got some pretty you know interesting ideas some people realize okay so if you can read sheet music and play notes why can't it look at me and and look at my hand positions and play notes so that my hand now becomes an instrument and sure enough it worked but again we were a little bit frustrated and our audience was a little bit frustrated because of some of these limitations with the first iteration of teachable machine well not long after maybe about a year and a half after they came out with a new version with a whole bunch of new features um and this brought me back to the project the new teachable machine now allowed for learning about poses images and sound so this really opened up uh things for us also you'll probably notice here on the slide it's a little bit small but the ability to excuse me to add new classes or new categories or groups so and and unlimited so now we could do the full alphabet if we wanted to or we could do a a very very very long range of musical notes and stuff so it really started opening things up more than that they added the feature that we've been waiting for and hoping for the ability to save your model and they give you a whole bunch of options you can save your model locally or you can save a shared link to the cloud and then pass that link to anybody else and they can load up your model so that really made it worthwhile to go back and look at what we were doing with our application one sec right so um go back and revisit our application and we went back and we said okay let's add the ability to um choose between using video train model versus a sound audio train model to be used and connected with our micro bit um we also added the ability to load a saved model uh from teachable machines so back on that previous screen where we saw the ability to save a model to the cloud so we're doing the one the shared link is what we're doing once you create that share link you just pop it in here after selecting what mode you want to use so we did that and we got back to here where we were able to now connect our train models uh that were saved in teachable machine to our micro bit um you'll see and it's it's worth pointing out if you do happen to go on the site there are some instructions as well so if you want to use it these instructions are found on the site and please feel free to use it please feel free to give feedback just keep in mind it is an alpha um it's something that um you know my code is really messy too but uh uh it is something that if we find that there's enough interest and it's useful i think we'll continue to pursue it and and and and work on it all right so now not only are we able to get video trained models and audio train models connected with our micro bit um we are now at the point where we're starting to think about the code on our micro bit and this is this is the great part so the code for for uh for the micro bit for understanding and doing things with the results of these uh trained models is very straightforward what we're doing is we're simply connecting a micro bit to our uh our usb to the web page we're pairing it in the same way that we pair a micro bit on make code and all we're doing is we're testing for the predictions that are coming back so when teachable machine thinks it's c sees the you know the letter a in sign language it's simply going to pass the label what its prediction to the micro bit over to usb so this is why what we're going to see here is we're going to see a block that maybe we don't see very often but it works very similar to any other event block it's called serial on data receive and it's the same thing as a radio block on you know a radio on received string or radio on on received number it's just listening for a simple event that's all that's really special about this connection um to this my uh teachable machine to micro bit bridge once we listen for that what we're simply doing is we're just using our conditional blocks or our logic blocks and most of us are familiar with that it's simply where we're testing the value and telling the micro bit to do something based on the value so in this case um we had a uh we had a sound model trained to recognize the word up down left right and kind of think about it as the beginning of you know being able to give your robot instructions or something like that and so we simply were listening for teachable machine model when it recognizes those voice commands and if it hurt hurt up it would show an up arrow down it would be a down up arrow so on and so forth okay so things were getting really interesting and we wanted to see where this could go well the micro bit what's really wonderful about the micro bit and i was talking a little bit about it earlier the fact that you know this is an external device it's inanimate until the coder our young kids get their code on it and then it comes to life so it gives them a sense of ownership um and and you know it's it's but we all know the microbit does a lot more it really also allows us to engage within our environment and this is really really important all the more so these days because you know we're a lot of us are at home a lot of us are spending a lot of time in front of the computer so the micro bit as a teaching tool is a fantastic way to teach about critical thinking and computational thinking um and coding obviously but at the same time to get our kids up and away from the computer there are projects that we can make for example you know sensing the light sensing the temperature and this is all wonderful because then we get them to explore and rediscover the physical environment around them so naturally we wanted to keep playing on this so our next step we did is well why not have it connect to a speaker to play notes well we we mentioned that before so if it saw a note or if it heard a word it could play we could sell it to play a song we could have it play one of the musical songs in micro bit by voice command and you'll probably have a sense of where this is going we could also connect it to lights well why not a fan and why not a belt that you probably saw that bell behind me we could do that as well why not or these that this is a micro vibrating motor and i'll this will come back later we'll see why this is interesting this particular one but suddenly we have a voice command for our micro bit that operates all these devices and what it's similar to is something like you know alexis or google home so we now have an opportunity to show our kids how these devices actually work and to explore some of the challenges there now the sort of challenges that you get there are really interesting and this is back to um what i mentioned earlier uh some of the deeper conversations that we would like to explore around ai and what we realized is that if we can get the kids excited about their projects if we can get the the ai into their hands so that they're building their projects getting excited about their project that excitement will get them to that next level of learning we've all been there before we've all been you know uh whether it's through hobbies or our own experiments or exploration when we get when we do something that we're excited about then we actually get into a learning mode we get hungry for more to understand it more to explore it to experiment curiosity experimentation and discovery right um and that's this is what's happened so at this point now we find that the kids or we're discovering and exploring the idea that the kids are more ready to actually have deeper conversations around ai might they not discover when they train their system to uh uh interpret um sign language that maybe it doesn't work well for all people who are doing the sign language does the size of our hand affect it does you know having multiple hands the the color the age do these all play in it and it's the same thing with voice i'll train it with for my voice but will it work for my daughter's voice um and then they get to test it and it becomes a fun thing to do fun experiment and then there are and that has a natural lead into these deeper conversations around you know built uh bias being built into ai systems and we've heard a lot about that or facial recognition and how facial recognition can fail so this is a great way to explore it and that's basically what we discovered but similar to our first project we wanted to do we wanted to have a project to use tech for good our first project the visual project about interpreting sign language we thought well what could we do now that we have you know that teachable machine supports training models around sound recognition well this is what we came up with so what we did is we actually used two micro bits here we had one micro bit which was connected to our computer that had the train uh sound model loaded um and then was using this this teachable machine to micro bit bridge that we built and what it was listening for were certain keywords and we imagine imagine this scenario where we have somebody who's hard of hearing and needs some assistance uh or could use some assistance in you know their home environment any environment so what we did is we then connected a second micro bit to a battery so it was autonomous it could move around it was mobile and we attached to it this small micro vibrating motor and if you want to think of it we all most of us have one if you have a mobile phone and you set it on vibration mode that's what it is now imagine you have that in your pocket and now your teachable machine to micro bit is listening for particular words or sounds maybe it's your name if somebody says fill and i'm not looking so i don't hear it our teachable machine to microbit recognizes it sends a little radio signal to the mobile unit in my pocket and it vibrates and then i know oh wait somebody might be calling my name you could set different different numbers of vibrations depending on the word so you can have all sorts of sounds that it can recognize so this was a really really interesting project to start exploring and that we're starting to build out i think it really demonstrates how not only can you know working with ai and micro bits be a lot of fun and make us understand a lot of the stuff that you know we're seeing out there like google home and stuff but it also empowers our kids to actually start prototyping their own solutions and ideas so basically this becomes a prototype a functional a a prototype to validate these these wonderful ideas and explore these ideas um it's really it's really quite quite rewarding now i just want to very quickly point out the text stack that i used to build this this this bridge so it's very simple there's something called um uh ml uh ml5 it's a library that is it's a javascript library that basically wraps teachable machine and makes it very easy to program uh it's in javascript um the other one is we use js i believe it might actually be the same library that that make code uses that's handling the connection the pairing over your web usb so your your your usb on your machine from the web page to your micro bit and then the rest of it is simply html javascript and css so there's nothing and all of this is open source so and you'll see that if you actually go on to our little web app or bridge uh everything is there to see um there's nothing server-side so so really cool there and then very quickly before we open up for a few questions what's next well we definitely want to try this more we want to get some feedback um and you know if if if it's you know if the results are positive we'll continue um developing it um but it's out there right now for anybody who wants to try it i think my email is there so if you have some comments you can easily contact me or if you need some help but in doing that well listen i we have just like make code we have our micro bit connected to a web page and it was at that point i said i started realizing well there's there's another possible area of exploration here and we've heard it quite a bit and especially in this time you know of covid um the idea of wouldn't it be cool if we could connect micro bits all across the world with each other over the internet so that's the next project i've been working on um using some of what i've learned in this bridge for teachable machine to microbit um now looking at connecting micro bits now think and basically think of the internet of things so um and you know you could have a micro bit in a classroom right across the world that's taking the temperature every day or the light level and that can data can be streamed back to you in your classroom and you can use that to to do something with your micro bit or you can just use the data and and and look at it you know and share that data all across the world so that's where we're sort of going with it and exploring uh this technology so it's it's quite exciting and let's see i do have let's see before i open up for questions i do have one example maybe i can share it with everybody because i do love it when we get to a chance to do some hands-on let me see if this is going to work we'll try it so i'm going to put something in the message and set this up i'm going to stop the sharing we need to see this so this is a prototype now i love old tech so i wanted to connect a micro bit and some of you might recognize this this is an old telegraph system this is the receiver um now give me a sec i'm just going to do a quick test all right so anybody yeah somebody's already opened the app and you are operating this telegraph here and you're doing it via a micro bit and a digital or solid state relay that's awesome i honestly i couldn't wait to do that the chance to have from people from all over the world operating this telegraph in my office is so cool [Laughter] so yeah and so you can see the potential there now you don't have to be using a web page you could have been using on microbit to do it phil is this the first time you've had it uh it live uh the first time i've shared it outside of the company yes well congratulations that is incredible you know making uh making some more micro bit history here everybody yeah and what a wonderful thing then to do it with history this this is an actual piece it's probably about 1920 and it was really in it was actually in use so yeah how fantastic and here's here's the here's the the kicker the device i use with the micro bit the relay which is basically just a switch to turn off and on the power because it uses it it needs much more power than uh our micro bit can supply well the relay is actually like the great great grandchild of the telegraph because it's the same thing it's a switch when you when you hit the telegraph you're opening and closing a switch this is a mechanical relay that's a solid state relay which is much more responsive yeah that's cool wait does somebody actually know morse code what's being sent here is there a is there a history so do you know where this this telegraph is was in operation bill no unfortunately not um i couldn't track down the original owner i do like to try uh this is one of my favorite hobbies is taking old tech and connecting it to micro bits um so i you know this is one of the projects that i have i have some old uh telecom machines and stuff like that that i i like connecting but i think it's fantastic because when you look at old technology sort of like brute force technology right um it's it but it's it's visible it's huge and it opens up another avenue of fantastic questions how did we get from this to something this small right it starts to make you think about that but this we can actually see it we can actually understand and look at it and see how it's working and then that makes us get curious about well how do we do it in solid state so it's it's a great avenue for getting that curiosity going and i tell you i can do the same thing like this and just put a speaker here and have a instead of the telegraph and have a modern speaker playing a note people are not engaged as soon as i pull out the telegraph suddenly everybody is like okay this is cool and yeah it's pretty much the same thing so i i noticed that in the chatter it's someone saying we need to build a a morse code decoder uh maybe that's the next piece with the micro bit especially with v2 and its speaker that can decode it and speak the uh uh the telegram has been exactly and one of the things you will discover and some of you probably already noticed this is that it also introduced a new programming tech uh challenge here a communication challenge because we know that using the internet you probably experience lag so there's probably like hesitations or delays between each key stroke well that wouldn't work with morse code morse code is based on a tempo there's dot dash dot dash and it has to be at a particular speed and if it doesn't happen then the message is garbly good so again this is a little bit this is a really let's say basic way to look at these challenges and you could code it there's a way you could code it in in in make code so that you buffer it all and make sure that it plays back in the right in at the right speed um but again a great way of introducing more modern problems like well how do we do that with wi-fi how do we make sure that the wi-fi signal is uh the integrity of the wi-fi signal and whatever data is being transmitted because we know for the most part data is pretty pretty reliable uh when you get your email it's not like there's letters missing in the email so how does it do that yeah a lot of fun a lot of fun um and but any so yeah so that's where i i'm hoping you all that's a real fun and i really wanted to show some hands-on but also the teachable machine thing i think is really fantastic um maybe we could teach the teachable machine to morse code so we talk to it and we teach it to to recognize words and then and then once it recognizes those words translate it into the write morse code write dot dash dot so there's all sorts of fun things we could explore phil just kind of scrolling through the uh the chatters and there's any other questions to uh to surface for you here uh i there's just some some big love and uh and excitement for for what you've shared uh around teachable machine and uh now this uh this telegraph so uh you've you've inspired i mean there's a lot of stuff over biker bit live and in the microwave community i'm probably not speaking alone to say this what you've shared just you know got me excited to even you know pull up the the micro bit and boot up the editor even this afternoon and play around with uh with some of these projects excellent quickly for uh for those who uh who are joining and just as a recap what's the best place to find you online and to look at some of these projects again okay so um at kids coding uh kids coding is uh the twitter for or a kids code jeunesse um i tend to stay off social media but also here i'll give my email as well sorry i i sprained one of my fingers so i'm a little bit slow at typing there we go and that i believe that's correct i'll just double check yep um so yeah if you want to tweet out to kids coding and just put my name in it i'm sure they're watching um yeah it's awesome uh you know i have so many other projects uh i'll just give you this this little guy here is actually a fairman it's a musical device with micro bits it actually detects the presence of my hand and as i put my hand through it it plays different musical notes um there's tons and tons of stuff we can do with the oh and let everybody know this is all micro bit version one it'll work with version two but if you have old micro bits good to go yeah oh that is such a an encouragement as well uh oh yeah yes yeah awesome love to come back well thank you everybody and and and uh thank you titus it was it was a a pleasure to to and and an honor to be able to present today it was really great it's uh yeah thank you we really appreciate it excellent well everyone we do have a short break before we can pop back on to our our last session for micro bit live uh so encourage you to pop back to the schedule and hear or find what you want to be inspired by next thank you all and thank you phil thank you i'm sure we're gonna hear telegraphs all day
