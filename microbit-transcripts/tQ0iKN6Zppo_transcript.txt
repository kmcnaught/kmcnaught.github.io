good morning and welcome to microbit live 2021 day two thank you very much for joining us this morning i know it's very early for some of you and it's very late for others of you but thank you so much for being here with us um we'll start with a little bit of housekeeping if some of you were with us yesterday you will have heard this already but for those of you who are joining us for the first time i think it's worth running through again um we're using a new platform this year hopping and we're really excited about it yeah we think it's going to be a great experience for all of you for those of you who were here yesterday hopefully you have um you enjoyed it as well um so a couple of hints and tips for when you're moving your way around the platform if you want to see the schedule at any time or schedule then click on the reception icon uh within uh the platform and that will list all of the sessions today um the stage is where you are now so this is where the um keynotes will be in the end and the beginning and closing sessions of the day so uh please join us there there's the sessions uh icon so that's where the 35 minute sessions and the five minute lightning talks will be and then there's the expo area so the expo area is a whole bunch of partner content from projects all around the world i highly recommend you have a look at it if you do get the chance it's brilliant there's loads of fantastic projects there it's an experimental area for us this year uh we've not done it before um so please give us your feedback on on how you like it and also there's a an icon in the chat so if you want to be in that area and showcase what you do next year then please let us know there the event is uh live for 32 hours um and there's the replay button so if you've missed any of this the talks and there are loads of talks and loads of content and they're all brilliant and you know trying to find the the one to do it the when they when there's three on at the same time is really difficult so if you want to come back and look at those then they are open for the whole 32 hours but they will be on youtube after the events finished so if you give us until next week they will be on youtube and you will be able to see them at your leisure there's a networking area so that is um you go into that networking area and you are paired with a random person from the conference and you have three minutes to talk to them you don't have to be in there for that full three minutes if you don't want but if you do then you can be and you know just to again reiterate that we are committed to running a safe and fun experience for everybody we have a code of conduct which you can get to via the platform if you want to have a look at that but if you think there is any inappropriate um uh conduct then please report it to us on help microbit.org that's help microbit.org excellent so for those of you with this yesterday it was a brilliant first day we had some amazing content and i just wanted to highlight a number of those talks and presentations which which uh you know i really liked you know again i haven't got to to go through them all yet um but you know there were some amazing ones there so we kicked off with um mitch and shauna from the scratch foundation who um talked about their scratch uh this the sec program that they're running uh which is you know bringing projects from all around the world and how they're using microbit within that that was very inspiring and we love working with scratch foundation so it was great to have them with us uh just to say again we've got 80 speakers from 28 countries um we've got people registered for the event from 90 countries it's a truly international event it's great to to have everybody here uh other content from yesterday's julo uh from hong kong uh talking about how to integrate microbits through the the whole school um all ages and and and cross-curricularly um brilliant you know if you if you do get a chance checking out some of the activities are really inspiring and i i really want to go back to school and join stu's class if i can i don't know whether he'll let me but i'm sure he he wouldn't mind um and we also had um a really sort of inspiring uh update from the british council on their western balkans project so this is one of the first sort of projects outside of the uk um it's across this five countries i think of the western balkans it's impacted sort of four thousand schools fifteen thousand teachers benefiting more than one million students but it's had a huge positive impact on uh all aspects of society and especially those uh what they've classed as vulnerable children are those from sort of more challenging socio-economic backgrounds those with um with autism those from minority communities and so really recommend that you check that out if you get a chance and then finally i just wanted to highlight james devine from microsoft research and the talk that he did on jack dac and uh accessibility solutions for people with disabilities and this was a a young girl with uh cerebral palsy called jara who wanted to use her amazon alexa other devices are available to play baby shark and she couldn't do it because the um the the it couldn't recognize the word formation that she was using and as part of a hackathon with a jackdac which is a new microsoft research way of more easily adding peripherals to microcontrollers they were able to create and hack together uh a solution for her to be able to listen to baby shark on her uh amazon alexa so that was that was amazing and uh walrus came up with the the comment that it was the best session with baby shark today um i think that should be a name for everybody presenting today to try and get baby shark into their presentations so lots and also you know peli is uh talking about jack-jack later on today so if you want to find out more about that then please do so amazing sessions yesterday some brilliant sessions that are coming up today uh we're really lucky to have uh magda wood who uh well we're really lucky to have magda wood within the foundation season our chief learning officer she leads our education department uh we're we are honored to have her as part of our organization and we'd like her today to share her thoughts um and talk to to talk to you a little bit more about microbits thank you magda nice introduction thank you very much hello from london um i'm magda wood and welcome thank you for joining us today um i'm the chief of learning as gao said and i'm responsible for the education team so doing lots and lots of thinking about teachers in in our team especially and i thought i would start um my talk by sharing photographs of the faces of um some of the children who have been learning with the microbit this year and sharing their work with us um for us it's brilliant because you know we we we work in different places around the world in the foundation like like most people we have the experience of working remotely and to be able to see the world's children and their work that comes into the foundation is is is is like the unbelievably uh exciting part of what we do um it it's it's it's it's brilliant to to see it and i just wanted to share the um faces of some of those kids so um today i've got the pleasure of taking you through three um children's projects that demonstrate really nice combinations of teaching and learning and showcase all of what i'm sure everybody here knows the benefits of putting the microbit into your classroom so the most important thing about it for me is it's about seeing people take ownership of technology seeing young children teenagers and their teachers um learning about this and really taking ownership of it and before i move into the kids um examples just wanted to talk through a little bit about what we stand for as an organization what matters to us um what we think about when we're working and what we're committed to as a as a foundation as a not-for-profit um so like i would um uh i know it seems like an obvious thing but i think it's worth spelling out we really believe in equal access to education for girls and boys and the importance of digital literacies obviously the removing of barriers for access to education especially technology education because that's the area that we work in is very important to us and we we um we have a strong focus on reaching as many kids as possible regardless of social and economic context and i'm a real champion of teachers um the importance of the role in the classroom cannot be underestimated um what's vital in work when we're thinking about what we do what motivates us that we believe it's vital and i'm sure everybody here does that it's to understand how computing technologies work and to have experience of learning to make things with technology so that you can then go on and apply that to your own ideas um and make that relevant to your experience of the world um what do we see happening um when we when we look at work that's happening around the world we we see teachers and students doing that together and really enjoying that moment when um not only does it things take off when the micro bit starts to work in your hand but when you take your knowledge of that and then apply it to your own thing um it's it's it's magical so some of the other things that tend to go well with that to really make learning really um successful is looking for opportunities to apply working with technology and learning about technology in other subjects um to establish some kind of interdisciplinary thinking um thinking about applying your tech your knowledge of technologies to your other subjects that you're learning about um because that's how it works in the real world and then building on what children are already learning there and allowing them to pursue their own interests establishing things that are meaningful to them we see lots of people starting early with young children and we know that's important because we we want to challenge fixed views of technology in science that that some children especially girls can can develop at a later stage in their school life and then we think it's really important to invest in professional development for non-specialist teachers and we see that happening around the world and you know that's the key to reaching as many kids as possible um and i think it's really important for us all to understand that's this stuff as well so and teachers are phenomenally good at learning new subject knowledge content and learning to teach it at quite a rate so um back when the microbit started its life at the bbc some of the research that they did established this fantastic sentence which i love which is teachers are the greatest influencers when it comes to kids engagement with coding and i'm sure if you are an educator if you've got experience in the classroom you have maybe got kids at school you'll know the difference and the impact that a teacher can make in a child's life um across many subjects but specifically for coding specifically for computing um this research established this um a couple of years back when it was really important to engage other people who are responsible for education um policy and and budgets etc to really embrace this idea that that teachers need to be key and involved in um bringing this into classrooms so the first um student that i'm going to introduce us to is hannah she's from costa rica and um well let's have a look at a video that communicates her project in action let's have a look now let's see [Music] [Music] [Music] bye [Music] fantastic let's move this on there so when when i watched that video i thought wow there's such a lot going on here that um uh is displays what hannah's um learned as she's um created this product that she's using that is working that she's able to put into um the environment that she's in and and to make it function and and let's have a look first at what was the origin of hannah's idea what was her motivation for doing it so um she's interested in two things which is helping people to conserve water and helping people to be conscious that during a pandemic you need to maintain good hygiene and wash your hands so hannah's solution to this is the product that we've just seen in action which is a simple timer that when you're about to use water you can set you can choose um what you're going what you're going to do are you going to have a shower you're going to wash wash your hands etc and then it it sets the time for you to do that based on her sense of what's a good what's a good amount of water to use and then it lets you know when you need to stop so really very nice very simple idea put into working action there so and let's have a think about what she's been doing when she's been learning that she's had to think about how can i get the micro bit to do this for me um what are we going to use that the microbit can offer to um plan out how we're going to actually make it work so the thoughtful planning process is a really key part of that she's got her idea she thinks she's got got the um the kind of problem and the purpose for developing it and now she's starting to to plan things out she's actually created um very impressive you know complexity and cut in her coding element of her project here you know she's done some fantastic work at this stage so she's planned out how to make it work and now she's been um setting up to program it and what's hannah learned during this process um she's learned that she can make something that it works um that she's thought about uh something that is significant to her and um responded to that and responded it to it in a way that um makes her realise that as a as a young person now so as a 13 or 14 year old girl now she can have an impact on other people she can she can um respond thoughtfully to challenges that we all share um as she is now she doesn't have to wait until she's in the digital pipeline of skills for for a country um etc it's about it's touching her life now and i think that's such a nice statement to to hear from hannah and and it's very nicely aligned to the the mission statement that we have at the foundation which is to inspire every child to create their best digital future a very broad statement but in in bringing it to life is hannah and how she feels about what she's accomplished um as well so that's why we started with hannah so this story so far from microbits there are six million in the world now we estimate that's about 30 million children learning with the micro bit and the micro bit is only six years old so you know you see a project like um the one that hana has done and no doubt ones that um many people joining us today will have their own experience off too um i look forward to the next six years and the next six years after that so let's have let's let's meet add it addit is a primary school age child from the uk and um i'm going to let him introduce his project to us my name is edith and this is my final young scientist for this i made a smart village project the smart village is based on a seashore with a beautiful beach um at the same time on the other side of the village over here is a river because of this natural beauty it attracts tourists a lot which come who come for a relaxing holiday but because of this um water surrounding it is prone to natural calamities even though um the dam over here is um controlling the river there's a high chance that when it rains heavily which it does in this part of the world then um the dam might overflow and the river will get flooded which also dangers the villages and over here the island is also prone to tremors which are like small earthquakes which then will cause two big waves which may harm the villagers so to stop this my project will allow the villagers to be alerted in time to go to a safe place where before these calamities happen so this tower over here um has the village's main light source which is this lamp over there and it is also equipped with the features to switch it on and off if it is dark or light so now if i shine a torch on it which will act as the sun the light will go off to save electricity and now when i put the torch off the light become comes on again similarly the island um is from the tremor so now if a tremors come in it shifts and then this um micro microbit which shows a wave animation which and makes an alarm which knows which alerts the villagers that um big waves are coming now let's have a look at how the warning on the riverside works so this is the dam over here and this is the river so if i put some water in the dam which is um which is this container which is acting as it if i put water in it before it gets full it will make a noise and flash the light and bring an alarm and show across which goes on and off so this system will alert the villagers when either of these problems will happen or like the angry seats giving big waves or this river over here flooding it allows the villagers to go to a safer place in time before the calamities happen brilliant so i think and it's on a fantastic job they're telling us all the many reasons why he's created um that working prototype of a complete system for um the coastal and ireland communities that he's been thinking about and what um apart from that being like phenomenally um sophisticated um and and comprehensive what i really like about that is it shows this young child combining interdisciplinary thinking he's building on what he's learning um with computing and learning to make the micro bit and and how it works and he's applying that to other knowledge that he's developing from other subject learning in this case there's lots of physical geography going on here so um and then he's created this whole system he's built this um beautiful um set into which he can demonstrate his working prototype um not only is that the outstanding work but it's also um it shows you how flexible how how adaptable the micro bit is i think to children's learning which is that um it's it's he's he's taken that and he's he's put it in there no doubt with lots of support and help around him but that is really truly at its work um and and he knows exactly how it works and and what it is a response to what it's what its purpose is in the way that he communicates that it's a beautiful example of communicating um his his knowledge because of he's got really lovely sense of vocabulary in there and and he's using it really nicely and i i congratulate both hannah and addict but that's a that's a great one because we heard from from adam in this case and when we asked him what's you know what have you got out of this experience what's it inspired you to do the the thing that he told us is that um he he wants to do more of it he wants to continue to explore his own ideas he wants to continue to um further think about um how to apply his knowledge of technology to to up to to ideas that he has to things that he's learning about and um i couldn't be happier uh and and i'm sure that um everybody around him found that really impressive and again no doubt these are daily experiences for them for many educators and um assistant staff that that work with kids in this way so let's um bring it to an end here with a project from colombia so we've got manuel and lucia and valentina and their teacher who um demonstrate they've got a project that we'll have a look at but what's nice about this project is that it it shows us how a school has taken um a long-standing citizenship education program um and an established science learning in there they've put what they call steam in now so science technology um engineering arts and math so nice broad uh range of range of subject thinking there and they're using the micro bit so they've thought about using the micro bit using their knowledge of technology in the context of citizenship of um impacting the social experience of people who live in communities in their country so what they've looked at specifically is um i guess they've been learning about people who live in rural communities in colombia who don't have access or reliable access to clean drinking water and they've created a prototype that is basically a product that can can provide you with clean drinking water as a portable um device so lots lots of really nice stuff going on there brilliant to see the school combining those two things um at that level at that institutional level and then let's let's have a look at um manuel who here who is presenting his um product to the community who for whom he's designed it foreign is so obviously i i didn't arrange subtitles for that video apologies for um non-spanish speakers but um with my rudimentary spanish i i could um understand and follow what what manuel was communicating uh in his presentation there but he's talking about why he's created it and what and what it what it does the um the the thing that i see there when i when i think about what these kids have got out of this experience of working on this project with that citizenship programme is how immersed they've been in thinking about solutions to challenges that people in local communities or communities in their country may have and again it's a it's a very nice example of um the microbit and children learning about computing technologies um thinking about things differently thinking about things outside of the walls of their classroom um and and you know i it's invaluable um to to see to see these education experiences in different cultural and social settings around the world every day of the year working at the foundation we see this and we're just really pleased because the micro bit works in all of those different contexts and that's that's what um that's what that's what the point of our foundation is is to make sure it's as successful as possible for for teachers and for students to use in their in their own way so having gone through those three projects it's my pleasure to say thanks to everybody who takes part in whatever level of learning that kids are having when that when when they get those access to those learning experiences um and it yeah it's a it's it's it's it's a real pleasure to to be able to present those three projects by those kids and and thank you so at the foundation this is my uh my little pitch here um we provide educational resources and we um continue to develop them in the background and i thought i'd just share something that's coming next year so next year we will be launching our free professional development courses for teachers they'll be coming early next year soon as as soon as a end of january february beginning with introductory courses designed to be easy to follow with lots of video tutorials to help to continue to support education programs and educators to learn to take their first steps with the microbit themselves and take them into the classroom and that's it from me i hope you have a really good day thank you for joining us and thank you for listening
