micro:bit LIVE 2021 | Redefining Physical Computing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="w3U8twQtIDM
brilliant thank you very much and say welcome to this talk which is a somewhat controversial title of redefining physical computing and uh and what does that mean and the reason why i called it that is that physical computing is an incredibly broad term as is project-based learning and one thing i've been trying to do and advocating for over the last few years is to change people's conception about what physical computing really is because if you look at the uh the academic text around what it means it can it's basically using technology in any form in a classroom to to further learning and i think it's become more precise than that and it's become more uh it's got sort of coalesced around using physical computing devices such as microbits and and obviously there's many others as well but the microbit seems to be the uh coming out as the du jour standard of physical computing devices certainly in k-12 education and so it makes sense to sort of redefine it in a way um where this this ecosystem of wonderful projects and resources and technologies um can be seen as sort of the the way to do computing in school uh and the main reason for that is because um so teachers still aren't uh you know in love with the microbit aren't in love with physical computing and um uh don't see it as a or at least unaware of it as a really useful tool for teaching computing and stem subjects more generally so i think part of this is sort of a it's a consciousness-raising exercise to try and get people to think about physical computing rather than a an incredibly diffuse abstract um concept but more of a as a thoroughly practical real world engaging way of teaching and it's effectively it's a pedagogy associated with resources and and so that's really what this this talk is all about and what do we mean by that and what are the different working parts um that go into it and everything you need to think about wanting to consider using pbl in the computing classroom so just to get the ball rolling um in the chat um what are your preconceptions about project-based learning and physical computing and when i say pbl or or physical computing i'm really referring to them almost does the same thing in this in this sense and it's it's a sense think of it as using microbits in the computing classroom doing projects to learn about computing stem engineering electronics uh programming all that sort of stuff together so that's just kind of wrapping those two uh words and those concepts together but please jump in the chat uh and just uh say you know what are you what are they assumed negative connotations as well as the positive ones i mean we've been hearing an awful lot of examples about uh all the positive stuff that happens doing but uh you may have worked with colleagues that see it as um as a you know a simplistic way of teaching um you know is it effective i mean we're seeing lots of good examples of it being affected but um how do people outside of this sort of the micro bit uh and computing bubble perceive it and you know how can we seek to get over those obstacles so as i mentioned before so the the literature defines physical computing and uh pretty much learning very very narrow very very broadly sorry and i think we see we need to um narrow that down a little bit and really sort of it should revolve around this idea of designing and making artifacts so you know that sort of a constructionist constructivist approach and using computers and digital technology uh to incorporate digital skills and digital skills is also one of these kind of nebulous terms um when you're talking about using technology but it's about you know using programming things be in python make code or whatever but really it's bringing those elements together so they're designing making ideating being creative and using digital technologies to solve real problems and it's drawing those concepts together and that really is certainly in my mind what project-based learning and physical computing is all about and you can see some examples there of some some projects there that instantiate that and show that as a way of teaching and learning and it's not just plonking a an ipad in a primary school and saying that's physical computing and that's that's the complete opposite end of the spectrum it's i see project-based learning as being a methodology a tool that you can use in the computing classroom uh and doing it in a specific way which is well structured well resourced and your teachers are confident building apply it to teach computing well and it not just being um just something that you might do once every once every now and again but something you can do often not necessarily replace the entire curriculum although you could there are examples of that uh the arm score program we have whole courses that you can replace and we've got grades for five through seven and key stage three in the uk um and this is a mixture of didactic and um and pbl but you know this this is a tool that should be used as widely as possible so let's unpack this a little bit because one of the um problems with pbl and physical computing is that it's it's quite complex there's a lot of moving parts and it's made up of a lot of different things and you need to be confident in all of these different areas um enabled to be it to be able to deliver it effectively and so um if you're sort of weak or not confident in any of these areas it can you can start to unpick it especially if you've got non-specialist teachers or teachers in like um in primary schools um you know or k-5 it um if you're not confident in some of these areas then it's uh it's it can be quite difficult and daunting to deliver as a pedagogy as well so um through the projects that are out there and through the training that's available you can certainly become confident and these are all these are quite broad but also quite shallow you know you don't need to have be um you need to have a masters in electronics or really understand all about um you know semiconductors and pcbs and all that sort of stuff to be able to use budget-based learning certainly with the micro bit and it's just understanding how these different elements come together um certainly would you should all i'd hope efficiently with the micro bit and what that is in terms of the hardware platform and sort of a simple understanding of how electronics works in sort of circuits is is useful and that goes alongside things like input process output and the whole idea of making and then there's all these other elements which we'll go through as part of this presentation but that's the sort of the the map the journey of project-based learning and how all these things fit together and also as you can see on the right hand side how the arm score program resources uh how we seek to glue those things together with a set of resources and training to try and make that as easy as possible and make that journey uh to delivering project-based learning in schools is as simple as possible so starting out with the hardware and i'm sure you've all seen the sort of stuff before but it's worth reiterating um some of the functionality and certainly when you're working with colleagues who who may be new to this or trying to introduce us into schools and and with students as well it's it's worth starting with what the uh what the features are and this is where some of the electronics comes into it and you don't need to go into this sort of the nitty-gritty of um you know what uh your artist and i square see and that sort of stuff but it's it's useful to getting students to think about what the inputs are and so things like the the sensors the accelerometer the temperature sensor the light sensor and if you have all the students that you're introducing this with you can start to look at some of the more nitty gritty about how that actually works and how these physical sensors really really work it really depends on your curriculum and what areas you you're seeking to to go into but you can you can cover some of the more complex stuff should you wish to and that's the the beauty about project-based learning is that you can adapt the content that you're teaching in terms of depth as much as you want to and you can do some of it didactic and you can do some of it project-based and you can cover whole swathes of the curriculum so having getting the students to understand how this works and it's can be quite simple obviously there's just the buttons and the inputs and all that sort of stuff and there's a really good video about how the new features on the v2 can expand what you can do with the with the micro bit as well and these new features are fantastic i'm really excited about the v2 um i was lucky enough to receive one and um it's really fun and adds a whole new um a whole new world of projects that you can do with it and opens up the opportunities to do some really interesting stuff and this um this is really good comparison shamelessly stole this from uh from johnny uh from a presentation he did at arm a while ago uh and it's when you're sort of explaining what uh micro bits to students and getting them to understand the physical nature of micro bit is comparing it to a smartphone which is something that most students will at least be familiar with you know there are lots of students who who's only experienced a technology at home maybe through their parents smartphone and so they can understand that you know that has buttons it has this touch screen it has leds and you know and bluetooth and comms and that sort of thing and so thinking about those sorts of terms it is just a device and conceptually a micro bit is you could conceive of it as just a smaller simpler less powerful phone so i think that really works in sort of translating what the hardware does and then when you get into the sort of the uh the programming aspect of it um it's i think it's um this is a bit that can come unstuck quite quickly if you've got especially low score teachers that aren't familiar with programming languages and things like that and um is being able to piece together the computational constructs which can seem quite abstract and complex and and and terrifying to certainly to non-specialist teachers um and then saying just you know do do the uh the color blocks you make make that simpler and they absolutely do and um you get the purists and computer science teachers who think no it has to be textually derived we have to do it in python or c or whatever and you know you have to be able to learn these uh computational steps um in this sort of the traditional way to be able to understand it effectively very much like how maths is taught as well you have to be able to learn how to do subtraction division and about to repeat it lots and lots of times for it to stick um but i believe certainly that you can you can use um you can abstract away that sort of textual element of in you've seen examples of this in some of the other presentations uh during this conference which is brilliant to see is that using these color blocks and linking the use of those blocks to solving real world problems makes it more tangible makes it more engaging and they can see that these um techniques that they're applying uh affects the real world and i think that's really really important for them to understand it and um there's not there's not a lot of literature to to to prove this directly although i hope there will be going forward um that um teaching um computational constructs in a way such as this where you are impacting the real world and um sensing real things and doing something with that data and still applying the same sorts of techniques you would be if you were teaching it in a dialectic sense but um being able to apply it confidently and then hopefully that the intention at least is to them for them to recall it confidently in an exam setting such as at gcse or formal exams that they may sit as part of their time at school and it just makes that learning journey a little bit interesting a little bit more interesting a little bit more engaging a little bit easier and hopefully just sticks a bit longer when when they come to thinking about it when they're recalling it later so that's i think that's an important thing to explore and something to understand is that it doesn't all need to be in text and that makeup is a really good environment to teach this sort of stuff and and again obviously this is all in mate code and we in sp of a course about that explores all of the different blocks um that uh they're going to make code and how they link directly to the curriculum and um how they can be exploited on specialists i think one thing um that's so more baked in um computer science teachers will think of make code or scratch in those sorts of technologies as being too simplistic they sort of see the color written the blocks how it removes the need to indent and you know curly brackets and all that sort of stuff and they just this i think it trivializes it slightly but arguably it doesn't and i think you can go quite far all the way to all the way through k12 and teach all of the necessary constructs or computational thinking elements through these blocks you just have to um challenge them effectively and and give them uh context and projects that use all of these blocks in different ways and in different combinations and the complexity comes from combining the different blocks in in complex ways rather than just it being complex just by the nature of typing it out in in the text editor so it's you can actually arguably go further than what you would do in maker than you would do if you were teaching them just python in in idle arguably but yeah it really depends on the delivery but you certainly shouldn't dismiss um make code as being too simplistic because it really isn't and you see lots of examples of very very simple stuff uh but you i'll go through today some more complex visions and as we've seen today as well in the other presentations there are some really complex stuff that you can do with this all the way through to like data science machine learning and the lag which is which is wonderful to see and really exciting so in terms of curriculum coverage um as we're seeing again today over the course of this entire um conference is that there's lots and lots of curriculum areas that are covered by uh the market principally sort of computer science but it leads really into um teaching math and uh design technology data science and all these different areas and that all sort of sort of coalesces around this concept of covering all of these different things using project-based learning um and whilst i advocate not to think of computer science so i'm using pbl in sort of in a cross-curricular fashion because schools tend to work in in silos and which is sad to see but it's just just a fact um subjects tend to swallow away from each other and when it's taught across quickly away that can sort of lose the impetus and can lose some of the curriculum links uh for computing or for master whichever subject is kind of owning that project i think that's uh that can be become complicated to to navigate um so like having a sort of computer science backbone and sort of making sure they are programming something meaningful but to leaning on things like design technology and data science and and and applying mathematicals as well as tools to be able to meet this all the computer needs is a useful way to think about it but it depends on on your context and what sort of classroom or subject you're working within so that's the sort of the big picture stuff now let's move into some of the the sorts of tools these are the sorts of the bricks and mortar that um that you can use to build up the pbl model and what's what's important concepts uh to for students to understand if you're able to teach for them to get how to do project-based learning effectively and this is arguably the most important one is this idea of input process output and it seems really simple at first but this is an element of the design thinking and the students have to be confident in translating um taking well taking physical world inputs like the temperature or the light level and measuring that using uh the sensors on the micro bit doing something with that data this is where all the sort of computational constructs come in you know using the logic um doing something with it storing it transmitting it analyzing it if you're doing data science and then having some sort of output and it has to go through that chain for it to be to be a pbr project there's no point just taking data in and storing it if you're not going to then analyze and do something with it and having that output could be something as simple as just having a smiley face on the screen or it could be you know sending it to another micro bit somewhere else to like a gateway micro bit which then stores it in the cloud or does something different there's you know a million different ways of looking at this this is just sort of the general framework and getting students to think about all micro bit projects using this um this process is is useful for them to be able to think systematically um about computing more generally and this is not just a way to look at microbes it's a way to look at technology uh you know in its entirety and get him to think about it's not just gathering data and transmitting it and how it goes through the internet and how it can go to different computers back to servers and then then transmitted back to the micro bit again even and go going full iot circle and thinking about projects also in how they tackle them and this is a an important concept and you see this in the gcc standards as well as the csta standards is um when you're thinking about projects is having a goal you know then you have to plan and design it so there's some like those uh those more stem design thinking elements and they have to develop and physically make the the artifact um you know it's not just developing it in code it's also developing developing physical artifacts as well it could be a robot it could be a micro pet it could be it could be almost anything and then testing it that's really important students hate testing stuff but it's a an important part of the process and with the physical project it's easy to make them test it because they have to see it actually moving and so it makes the testing fun it's not just kind of like unit testing code where it can be quite dull and students don't really engage with it and they're evaluating it and they evaluate it by referring back to the original goal or the success criteria and going through that loop lots and lots of times is really important and this is maybe one of the weaknesses of pbl is that students are scared of failing and uh it's it's about building resilience in learners and getting them to you know fail early fail often and you'll go through this process many many times and in the uh the arm score program resources we um we use it success criterion it kind of ramps up in complexity so that our students go through it they're challenged and sometimes they have to go back and pick previous solutions and then refactor them in a way that is more complex and so you kind of you're getting you're kind of forcing them really to do it wrong and then do it right or not do it wrong but do it one way and then think about it and doing in another way which is which stretches them a bit further and then you can really build in that complexity um be it on the physical side or on the programming side yeah there's there's lots of different ways to take it but going through that development cycle is uh is really important and you can see examples of this in the uh the arm score program resources they're all freely available on school arm.com uh there's uh the micro course book we're just about to launch a new one of these in the new year which involves some data science projects uh using the new v2 functionality which is really exciting a lot of fun uh writing those but the version one one is on there on the website please do have a look at that also check out the youtube series uh we've got two uh whole playlists one of them is introduction to computing micro bit which takes you through all of the uh the blocks in in mate code and how to apply them in the classroom and then another one for microparting which is a huge course there's i think 30 odd videos on there about how to do micro python that's aimed at sort of uh gcse or sort of grades um 10 through 12 effectively and it's hard to program effectively and they're all animated they're all nice and fun to do check those out and these um are all project-based learning videos so let's have an example of how do how does the arm score program define what a pbl project actually is um and so these we're going to use some of these headings which are baked into all of our resources and so first of all we have setting the scene which is sort of contextualizing the problem for the learners so something which has been designed so that students can uh empathize with and be at least familiar with now this this example is used for really young students so like primary school students so you know k through uh grade four for example um and so it's something um that they may be familiar with especially with the current um pandemic for example and so we we set the scene and as you can see with this one they have to um you know create an interactive pet and the key bit there is interactive and that's the kind of that's the opening up of the potential for this project and then we have the success criteria and this is the most important part of the uh of the asp schema it lays out the um the challenge of what they have to do and it starts in poland you can see and gets more complicated and he's open-ended towards the end as well so as you can see they have to make it there's as you can see in the top right as well up there there is a net that we provide and so they can cut that out and make the pets they can call them in all that sort of stuff and so there's a slight challenge there how do they get the micro bit to sit inside the pet and be the face you can see some of them have used googly eyes and sort of velcro tape to stick it inside there and so there's they can be really really creative and you can do that in a lesson depending on the age range of the students but i've seen also the students who do this with much larger pets and they make them out of like cereal boxes and and the like and you know they have all sorts of things going on on them and make them very creative and you can attach motors and to make wings flap and all that sort of stuff as well but the idea is it has to be friendly uh to meet the uh to meet the context of the the problem has to contain the micro bit has to have a face which is important because then in the next bit they have to make it interact with the user and that's where the challenge comes in is how do you um how do you program interactions and this is where the skill comes in and this is where the learning happens because students have to interpret what is an interaction how do you play with a toy like this and how do you sense what someone is doing with the pet and how do you process that information how do you take that input how do you process it and then how do you have a an output which makes sense to the user so you can see the ipo model being used straight away and it could be something as simple as um it's got a smiley face by default you pick it up you might shake it vigorously it doesn't like that so you're triggering the accelerometer it might have a threshold let's say of a g and if it goes above that it you know it doesn't like it and then it has a sad face so import process output and that's a very very simplistic um version of this but you can go all the way through to really really complicated ones where you've got different pets that can play rock paper scissors automatically they transmit there yeah it randomly selects one of the three it transmits it via radio uh decides who wins and then the winner celebrates et cetera and these are projects which are born out in our micro course book and you can see the little dog there in the middle as well um this was really interesting project because the students um they when without even being taught about variables they worked out that they could have um a hunger variable and so which would decrement over time so they were using loops and so it would um you know start at 10 let's say and go down to zero and then it would get hungry and be sad and then they put another micro bit on the bone which transmitted via radio on a very low power um you know a number and the dog was uh programmed so that as the bone got close to it it received that number and then that incremented the the hunger variable and so it fed it so you know the bone feeding the doc import process output and so you can introduce some of the more complicated computational constructs through really fun uh and engaging ways and the student did that off their own back that and they did these in groups obviously and um but it's it's that's the kind of the discovery learning element and whilst that wasn't intended as part of that lesson it was just a natural consequence of the the project in the context and the context which was really really fun to see so this is where we uh advise people to start if you've never done um projects before with asb resources and it's a really fun one to play with so and here's some of the other things that um we sort of structure or the scaffolding which we provide to the learners who do this sort of project um to uh to have a go at is you know going through um these sorts of interactions there's lots of things to play with so back to this and so we've covered the hardware some of the basic electronics involved in that ipo making we've looked at an example of project-based learning now the cover in the curriculum that this is all of our resources are mapped to uh the csta curriculum and the uk um one as well they have engaging context and they they generally are solving real problems and we have that global goals link as well as part of that so um whilst that project isn't necessarily strictly a global goals link all of the projects in the uh in the micro course are and they all involve applying computational constructs uh and programming through make code so you can see we're already starting to get through uh all these elements uh using some of these types of projects so let's introduce the uh the unscore program schema this is this is the the headings which talked about before and these are the sort of the backbone of what uh make up all of our resources so the getting started the context setting the success criteria and then you have pro tips which is like the scaffolding where you can give them partial solutions cheat sheets and also there's the the lesson content the didactic stuff like slide decks and worksheets and that sort of stuff which you can apply in whichever way is relevant to your learners and all the learners you can you don't need as much of that you can just give them the success criteria in the context and they can solve it themselves younger learners um will need a bit more structure but more scaffolding and also depends how much experience they've had with um with with micro bit and programming more generally as well so that's down down to the teacher to decide how much support they need to give but from from my perspective we seek to give as much support or as any student would need and then the teacher can decide how much they need to apply uh the stretch tasks are like additional success criteria essentially they as you can imagine it's some students will get through it quicker and get through really quickly and so you need to be able to give them additional challenges which keep them on task and it keeps them within that sort of subject domain um and so they just don't go off and do really wonderful things which students um students do and you want to kind of constrain that learning on to what you want them to be focused on and then the final thoughts is the um so the summary sort of wraps up like you have learned x y and z and it relates to the context that we were learning about in this lesson and it gets them to reflect and think about evaluate what they've done in that lesson and so this this is sort of the broad scheme that we apply to everything that we do in the arm score program um including all of our teacher cpd as well and it just gets a nice box to put things in so we've covered sort of like a more simplistic one but um what's really interesting and how the sort of the whole world of computing is is uh evolving is going towards kind of data science and which is really exciting to see and this is more in the sort of the more towards the 12 end of the spectrum rather than the k um but it's it's it's sort of taking these uh these computer science elements and and some of the maths elements like statistics and using them to apply and analyze data gathered through computing and iot and um and learning something from them so going from data to information to knowledge uh you know and and that's getting to that knowledge of it is where sort of the data science comes in is taking that data and analyzing it in a meaningful way and then using that to solve a particular problem and then you can see that well data science can be used to do lots of interesting things you see it applied in like banking and all the rest of it and you know using machine learning models to predict people's behavior and that sort of thing and part of the uh the experiential learning of this is using machine learning to solve real world problems how can machine learning can be can be used to solve the global goals for example and there's a whole world out there and this is very very very new and some of these technologies are very very bleeding edge but it's it's worth sort of opening students eyes to the world of how data science can improve the world not just be used to sort of capitalize from it in a business sense i think that's an interesting concept to think about when creating new sorts of projects and then you have the whole world of iot which is very emergent still and it's um you know electronics being baked into everything and you can you can prototype rapidly prototype iot solutions um using a micro bit um you know and so you can um we see lots of examples of that where people are making elements that take taking the outside world and do something with them it's really interesting to let students know that all of this stuff that you're doing it's you know it can be iot especially if it's um transmitting data from from the home or from the school or whatever and you know this can be applied to almost anything and again it's like consciousness raising of that this stuff that you're learning isn't just like a fun project this this is the sort of thing that um developers and we you know partners that we work with arm do this is their full-time job the startups and businesses that do this everywhere and they're taking this technology and applying it in the real world to solve problems for business uh and uh you know so there are careers in this sort of thing and you know that links to that yes i want to study stem because i want to go and solve uh real world problems um and there are even technologies proper iot technologies for micro bit and just an example here where you can actually transmit data over iot networks from a micro bit to the cloud so you can analyze it and you can do some quite sophisticated analysis on on that um on that data and we've examples of that and some of our teaching and learning resources available on the school website and so this this idea of engaging context i think this is incredibly important we've seen lots of this throughout the the conference as well uh using these these uh the sdgs the um the global goals as a way to to teach uh produce-based learning things fantastic set of resources and i'll just go through an example now of one that we wrote a couple years ago now which is really really good fun and so this is focused on goal 14 it's creating an oil spill cleaner upper and you can get this in the micro course book and effectively students need to create a autonomous boat drone and so you need some motors to to power it you need to build the boat itself it has to float you know we don't want uh wet microbits and whilst it's only you know low voltage it's uh it will break them if you if you took them in the paddling pool and so they have to um this this boat drone has about to drag a smart material sheet to soak up oil effectively so that's the challenge and it can seem quite complex um but you know we we did this with a group of year eight students so so grade eight roughly um and um they engage with this really well as a full day project and so this is another way of applying these projects is uh um having like collapsed timetables where you spend a good chunk of time um in delivering these projects and so they set the scene you know there are there's oil spills all the time you see this in the press and we have to create an algorithm that can you can set out a whole fleet of these autonomous boat drones and they go out and soak this stuff up automatically and so it has to go to float has to be autonomous and it has to be able to drag the smart material so that those are kind of the three key points there um and so thinking about this in terms of ipo it has to set it off with a button press you have to program an algorithm that makes the boat go up and down over the oil spill and that's able to control the servos in doing so and that's the sort of the base level of complexity and you can take it more complex from there in terms of dealing with ambient sea conditions for example how does it deal with waves how does it avoid collision with the micro bits with other micro boats how does it deal with wind those sorts of things can you use gps for example there's loads and loads of additional complexity you can bake into this should you wish to and it's a good idea to get them to design this beforehand this is like sort of a nice uh the lesson before for example you get them to think about this and design it in our resources we provide these design thinking templates for them to start to think about that is beforehand and so this is this is why it's a good collaborative group project as well um because um you can do all this one person could be designing the other person then implementing it and you go through that kind of iterative development cycle and there's an example of the the sorts of things that they might want to consider um just you need to have wheels on both sides or a single thing at the back you know there's loads of different ways of doing it so um why do we know why are these different elements why do we get them to work in groups why do we get them to um work in this way and this pulls on to fulham's six c's um you know getting them to work in this we're solving tangible real-world problems it builds um collaborations to have to collaborate to get this stuff done because these challenges can be quite meaty they have to spend a lot of time working together they have to think critically they have to apply sometimes novel tools like you know micro bits and make code too to solve these problems after able to work out how these computation elements can be used to solve these problems they have to do that through communication and they also have to be creative in how they do it not just in how they program it but also how they build the artifact and these things build character and citizenship because they are solving real world global goals through the application of technology and programming and stem skills and so it's kind of like draws all of these different elements together in through pbl i think that's the that's exciting bit of that and so in in summary this is uh the sort of the the world of of pbl it's a all of these different elements all coming together um to sort of shape what computing is uh and what uh physical computing and pbl can be imagined as and so this is really like an open question is there is this a useful way of defining physical computing and project-based learning and um if it is then please do check out the onscore program resources because they are they're all available if you're interested in the um the theory that goes behind all of this this is a snapshot from our edx course which is a teacher cpd available on edx.com i think it is org and this is the learning landscape and this shows you all of the different theories and orthodoxies that underpin this approach to project-based learning and physical computing it's a it's a really complex world and i didn't quite appreciate when i first went into this how much um literature and orthodoxy there is out there surrounding project-based learning as an approach and so if you want to learn more about the sort of the underpinning learning theory do check that out it all pieces together really really well and we explore that through the course it's quite a quite a chunky course but it's really detailed and it's it's a mixture of theory practice assessment and soft skills um which is quite nice to see and that's as i say available online if you're familiar with the um the theory already uh if you're aware of that then maybe jump to course two have a look at the application where it goes through a bit more detail the asp approach and the other things you need to think about and the assessment one is quite interesting because there's uh pbl can be quite difficult to assess um and this goes through some sort of classic assessment theory which teachers might not be aware of and this is you know learning from my time with the the exam boards um and how we can use those sorts of skills to assess project-based learning and then the last course is all about soft skills teamwork in the wider curriculum and working with stakeholders working with head teachers organizing stem activities within schools how to do them how to fund them how to organize them that sort of stuff this it's a really really diverse set of resources which are really useful if you want to implement uh physical computing or project-based learning in your classroom so um please do check that out the courses are are free um they there is a paid for certification if you need that sort of thing but if you don't um if you just want to access the material for free go through the audit track so that's the that's the way that edx define it and then you get access to everything um for um for free and for a given amount of time i forget what the amount of time is but it's you can access it and if you do want the paid for certification then you can if you want to so yes thank you very much um has anybody got any questions or in the chat and if not i
