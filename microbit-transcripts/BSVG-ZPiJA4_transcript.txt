um what i'm going to be talking about today is ideas for content localization and how we can make things as relevant as possible for our students um you know at code.org our vision is that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science you know very similar to the um the vision that microbit has as well as many of the different organizations working in this space the particular component of you know echo.org we create curriculum and do a bunch of other things but the specific piece i want to focus on as we think about every student is the kind of the localization of the content because right if you're only if you only can use the content that's available in your language or that's built specifically for your country that really limits what you're able to use and so i want to talk about some strategies for opening that up so that you have access to even more content that's being developed all over the world um so i'm going to give a little bit of an example based on what we do at code.org but this applies to like i said lots of different organizations around the world right so the first step is around right translations and subtitles this is the kind of obvious first step that a lot of organizations take and so this is all of the content that you see on the platform whether it's the teacher facing lesson plans the student facing content subtitles in the videos all of that content being translated that's really important but that's certainly not sufficient right we need to go beyond that so the next step that we try to do is we dub our videos into different languages and this is work that we are taking on right now um but again still right the text on the screen may not be translated or you know the voice doesn't match you know what you're seeing you know there's the lips move on the screen and so not that ideal experience and so really you know what we try to do is is we're starting a process of reshooting these videos with local um you know uh people who can be uh role models for students and so we've started this as a pilot project in france um and we're you know doing this in lots of other languages in the future as well uh to give you you know one example right this is what it looks like when we do the translation of the in video text and the dubbing uh so here's an example in france so it's the same you know it's a person speaking english but at least you you know you can read the blocks that are being displayed to you in the video but really what we want to get to is what you see here on the right which is where it is someone you know for this for example the employee of amazon in france um who can talk to students about uh you know what it's like doing the work that they do in their native language and so it can be as smooth as a process as possible as as students learn um [Music] and then you know there's lots of areas where we can go beyond this you know so for example here's you know we've completely flipped the um the view of our site right normally the toolbox is on the left and the coding spaces on the right but for right to left languages like arabic as you see here we've flipped that and we even work with some partners who change the characters in our courses so for example this is a partner we worked with in jordan called edrock and they took and put in a different character that students in the local environment would recognize so really excited to see that and then some quick tips for teachers you know you may not be able to translate a full course um but you can change the examples that are being given in the content right so if it seems like it's a very u.s centric example and you're outside of the us don't hesitate to change that mix and match what you're doing by bringing in you know pairing microbit with code.org for example a lot of people do that so don't feel like you have to just use one you have to use a full thing you can take pieces from different parts and mix them together and then you can also reorder the lessons and this is an example from an organization we work with in thailand and the government agency who built this coding thailand initiative and they've taken these are elements of our courses that they've put in different orders to match the local education standards so that's a great way as well to make it more relevant to your students and i would be remiss if i didn't say you know you can always help translate if that's something that you want to do or able to do and here's how you can do that with code.org and with microbit so again apologies for the delay but thank you so much
