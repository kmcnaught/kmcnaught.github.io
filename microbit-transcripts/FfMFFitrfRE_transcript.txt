a big welcome to all of you to microbial life 2021 my name is waris kendra and i represent the foundation in apec it's great to see many familiar faces friends and family on microbial education foundation i'm so honored to be the first one to greet all of you today and what can i describe how excited i am this is the first 32 hours of microbial life and i'm absolutely amazed to learn that our attendees are from 92 locations or countries from all over the world i know that paaso is there from tokyo konichiwa jaiwan from seoul anya haseo and there's just so many of you i hope we can catch up during this 32 hours i'm staying up if any of you are staying up and i'm super delighted to be here a great opportunity to meet all of you again super passionate educators and champions in our communities welcome to beach tracy from scratch foundation it still feels like yesterday when we met in person for scratch day in shanghai back in 20 2019 in december just before the pandemic started despite these challenges all of us are still working hard in our own ways with many initiatives to inspire our next generation to create their best digital future with that mission in mind without further ado i would like to introduce you to our very own northern star the ceo of the foundation mr garrett stockdale thank you boris and thank you for that lovely introduction um i'm a bit worried that you said you would stay up for 32 hours i hope you're not going to and if anybody listening to that is planning to do that i highly recommend you don't um welcome to microbit live 2021 we're really staked to have everybody uh join us uh i'd like to hear a virtual whoop from everybody if that's possible um yeah i think i'll hear that that's great thank you so much um a little bit of housekeeping before we start so um [Music] if you do hear a fire alarm it will not be a um you know it's not planned so please make your way to no money joking i don't need to do that sort of

after the the events finished uh all in good time um there is a networking area uh so if you enter the networking area you will be paired randomly with somebody and you will have three minutes to talk to them uh sort of a bit like virtual dating i'm assuming um you don't have to spend the three minutes uh but it's there if you do want to and those areas will be uh available for an hour after the live sessions finish we're committed to um microbit live being a safe and fun event for all um we have got a code of conduct uh which you can view within the event um and if you do see anything um that you want to report or anything you don't think is appropriate then please contact us on help at microbit.org so that's help mikebid.org and we will try and sort that as quickly as we can so that's all they the housekeeping done uh it's amazing to have you all with us today and all you brilliant people and it's brilliant watching the chat and seeing uh all of the countries from around the world that are are represented uh i'm assuming that you all know what the microbit is uh if you don't then you're in the wrong virtual event but i don't know whether all you know about the microbit educational foundation so if it's okay i'd like to spend a few minutes just explaining who we are as an organization and what we stand for so we are a not-for-profit and uh the microbit project itself started in 2015 2016 in the bbc in the uk and the bbc brought together 29 partners to create the microbits resources um teacher training and distributing microbits to all year seven or equivalent children in the uk and that was in 2016. the mic educational foundation was formed in 2016 um as a not-for-profit and was created to continue to support teachers in the uk as they continued their learning with microbit but also to open the microbits to all countries around the world and that's what we've done as an organization i'm just going to share my screen briefly if i am able to and okay i've struggled to do that but that's fine we'll go without the sharing screen but i wanted to um you know talk to you about our vision so our vision is to inspire every child to create their best digital future and we think that digital skills and digital creativity are foundational skills for the 21st century and we believe that um all children and young people show up access to those skills so if you break down our our vision statement so it has every child in it so we think our role is to broaden participation to allow more children to take their first steps with digital creativity and digital skills we have a particular focus on girls and on underrepresented groups we think that not only will these skills allow for a better brighter job prospects as the digital skills gap needs to be filled but the concepts and and understanding of how technology works will help all young people take a better and more active role in the discussions around how technology should be used to shape our future we want to inspire and we want children to create we don't want them to be digital consumers we think that physical computing is a brilliant tool to allow children to share create follow their passions and create solutions to problems that are important to them and we want them to create their best digital future not only to improve their ability to thrive in the future world work uh to take an active role in shaping the future um debate of how technology can be used but also by diversifying those that create technology solutions we can create better technology solutions that serve more of society in a better way there are around six million markets out there in the world and we have projects in over 30 countries um and the microbit is available in over 70 countries so it's it's great to to be here and to be able to talk about that today a few thanks before we get started so thank you to fair chance learning who are partners who you will see moderating and facilitating this event today uh they are an amazing partner and if you haven't had the chance to work with them i highly recommend it and they are brilliant um thank you to all the speakers we have uh 80 speakers from over 28 countries or from 28 countries um who have given up their time to share their thoughts and their experience with you today and also finally to say thank you to all of you for joining us today i know everybody is incredibly busy and you know for all of your hard work and dedication and continuing to educate children throughout the pandemic but thank you for spending time with us today and hopefully we can all share our experiences and help each other so partnership is at the heart of what we do as an organization and is at the heart of our values uh we love collaborating with lots of different organizations and partners and one of our favorites is the scratch foundation we love working with them and we're so excited to have them here today helping us to kick off microbitlive 2021 again if you don't know what scratch is you are probably in the wrong virtual event but you know it scratches the world's largest coding community for children it has it is used in over 200 countries in 70 different languages we are inspired by scratch as a concept every day we are inspired by scratch as a tool used by children and we are inspired by what those children create using scratch and we are inspired by shawnee young who is the um the executive director of the scratch foundation and by mitch resnick who is the chair of the scratch foundation and we're deeply honored that they are able to join us today to kick off uh microbit live 2021 so thank you all for joining i hope you have an amazing time and over to mitch and to shauna to take us away thank you very much great thanks so much gareth we've had such great interactions over the years we're so honored to be here to help kick off this wonderful event thank you so much gareth it's so exciting to be here be part of the microbit family and excited to share a little bit more with everyone about the work we've been doing at the scratch foundation and it's great to have such a community of educators you know gathering from around the world because again it's a big part of what we do with scratches trying to see how we can support educators around the world uh just as the microbit foundation does uh to make sure that we provide them with new opportunities to support young people in creative explorations absolutely and actually with that we'll talk a little bit about the launch of the scratch education collaborative which i'm excited to share that the microbit foundation is one of our partners in that work and we've really been seeing a huge impact in ensuring that kids around the world have the opportunity to create and learn and share good morning mitch it's great to see you so uh here uh here i think sean and i are both uh it's around seven o'clock at this time so it's a good way to start the day absolutely absolutely i like jumped out of bed and i was like i'm ready to go so uh i i apologize if my voice is a little raspy but really really excited to be here and to co-present with mitch on the work we've been doing at the foundation yeah well the past year has really been a really sort of exciting and transformational year you know for scratch although there's been of course so many hardships around the world it's just tragic the way you know that the pandemic has affected so many educators and children around the world often having its you know sort of deepest impact and those who you know could already facing many challenges but through all of that we've continued to be inspired by the work of educators around the world of how through all of this you know they've taken it on creatively to open up new opportunities to help young people around the world to be able to express themselves connect with one another uh and to meet a lot of the sort of the mission goals of both microbit and scratch so it's been really inspiring to us to see the way the educators have joined together and expressed their creativity you know during these challenging times absolutely mitch i think about i was a science teacher science educator and how meaningful and powerful that work was and just imagining what that would be like in the midst of a pandemic where you just want to make sure your kids are okay and you want to ensure that they still have this opportunity to learn and create uh but everything is just turned upside down in the moment so i just want to say for take a moment to say thank you thank you thank you uh the scratch foundation thanks you for your commitment to our kids around the world we want to do whatever we can to continue to support you as we go along this journey together i mean on scratch it's really led to a real surge of activity on scratch as young people and educators even while isolating their homes have come to scratch as a safe space to be able to express themselves creatively and connect with one another so i think in the past year i think activity on this on the scratch website has like doubled in the past year there are like 30 million kids around the world who created projects with scratch in the past year absolutely um also i started as a the foundation executive director last november so it's in the midst of the pandemic uh the team had already revamped scratch uh day to scratch month over the summer to make sure that kids and educators have a chance to really engage with scratch and we created more virtual events we also created opportunities for families to do scratch virtually so we've been active trying to think to learn about the needs of our community and meet those needs head on yeah well it's really been a really you know active year both for scratch as an organization as you know shawna mentioned she started a year ago and just shortly before that is when scratch moved out of mit as some of you know scratch started in my research group at the mit media lab which is at scratch grew and grew and educators like all of you around the world were using scratch and helping to support it in many different ways it sort of outgrew our group at mit so we moved it to this you know separate independent nonprofit the scratch foundation uh and brought in you know sean as executive director to build a sustainable organization to support all of that activity around the world absolutely and um just quickly note we started the year of 2021 launching the scratch lab which was a great creative way for kids and educators to really test out new technologies new blocks um in a separate space and so that's still available for those who might want to learn a little bit about scratch lab i think one thing that sean and i both really feel is that at the same time that we're you know you know building this organization we're also continuing to work at building the educational movement because we see scratches much more than just a programming language you know many people might see scratch as a you know easy to use programming language which it is and it's also an online community where young people can share their creations so when they create games and stories and animations with scratch they can share it in an online community and get inspired by what others create and get encouragement and feedback from others but in addition to being a programming language and a community we do see scratch as an educational movement bringing a new approach to education that i think is very much aligned with what gareth was talking about what microsoft education foundation is also looking to do to try to bring a new approach to education to open up opportunities for for all children to be able to imagine create share and learn absolutely um i for me i i know that starting with the foundation and and thinking about my next opportunity when i learned about like scratch if i knew about scratch already but it wasn't just a platform it's a movement i was like sign me up i'm all for an educational movement because i truly believe that we want to ensure that kids have the same opportunities around the world regardless of their economic backgrounds regardless of where they live i was really excited to hear and get to know garrett and the microbit foundation for the work that they're doing in terms of anchoring their work in diversity equity inclusion our foundation is doing the same we know that we have to do more that just being free of charge is not enough in terms of a platform they were working together with microbit foundation to think about and be in the communities around the world who have in many cases the least amount of access to to micro bits and to to scratch as a technology a platform and an educational movement and then and this year as shawna led a strategic planning you know effort you know at the found at the scratch foundation as we came up and thinking about the vision for scratch it wasn't just about supporting kids learning to code we talked about supporting and spreading a creative caring collaborative equitable approach to learning and coding and i think those are really at the core of what you know the scratch you know vision is about is supporting allowing all young people to participate in that type of creative caring collaborative equitable environment absolutely and we launched um at the start of last year applications for our new scratch education collaborative we actually launched with 41 um organizations around the world uh you'll meet some of them here today uh to tell you a little bit about the story we knew that we wanted to do more of this work in communities and that as a foundation it's best to partner with those who are doing the work in the communities so we launched our application we had over 325 organizations around the world apply to be a part of the scratch education collaborative i don't want to steal too much thunder of elaine atherton our director who will be sharing more about the the collaborative but really would like to say thank you for so many of you i'm sure you're also with us here today this morning in boston for mitch and i at microbit live and we're excited to hear more about the work that's being done and for you to learn more about what we're doing at the foundation and again thank you so much gareth and michael but foundation for uh really partnering with us on this important work and we see many of those organizations that are doing really you know work creative uses of scratch many of them are connecting with micro bit as well i think it really speaks to that close connection uh and i think we see as i was thinking about you know this session i was realizing they're really two different types of connections that we talk about between scratch and micro bet there's sort of the sort of physical connection that it's possible to use scratch to program your micro bit to get use the micro bit sensors to con for kids can use the micro bit uh and program the sensors to control their games and animations on the screen so there's that the connection just within a scratch project and a micro bit project but there's also a deeper educational connection between the two organizations that both organizations have this deep commitment to creativity and equity in the work that they do so we're really proud of this connection uh to do that um maybe may i was gonna bring home by giving some examples okay yes i was gonna say mitch i know you have some stories please share some stories because you know i think that it's been great actually it was great to see juarez kicked off the conference because i have such great memories uh he was mentioning seeing me right before the pandemic in a workshop in shanghai and i've been with him at workshops in shanghai and hong kong and seoul korea and also texas in the united states so all over of bringing scratch and uh micro bit together and just see the creativity that grows out of that combination i was going to show some images from one of those workshops to give you a sense of what it is that kids are doing when they bring scratch and microbit together now i'm going to try to share my screen i know gareth wasn't able to do it i hope i have a little better luck to do this let's give it a try and i think i'm getting there there hopefully you can now see that um so these are images from a workshop actually this is in korea one of uh a group that we've worked with over the years uh is a future lab a wonderful maker space that's organized by the smilegate foundation and they've been really active users of both scratch and microbit so this is a workshop with a group of kids i think they were like maybe you know 10 to you know 12 years old and i think one thing you can see here is that one of the things that we love about the micro bit and scratch combination is the kids get to do two types of creating and making they're both creating physical things in the world like you can see in the top left photo they're creating uh the kids created out of different craft materials a steering wheel for a car then on the screen they created a scratch project of a of a driving game so they're both creating in the physical world and creating in the coding in virtual worlds and since we're really dedicated to helping kids develop as creative thinkers well the best way to cultivate creativity is by giving kids opportunities to create i think both microbit and scratch give kids these opportunities to create so if you just look at some of these other examples i think in the top right they were embedding a micro bit in an egg because it was a story about some fantasy where an egg was this magical egg and they embedded the microbit and the egg and it interacted with the scratch project or on the lower left they were using craft materials and again i just love all the different materials you see there there's felt and construction paper and glue sticks so it's not just about electronics and coding but creating with all types of materials if i remember right i think they were creating a a hippopotamus puppet that was going to be used to control a hippopotamus on the screen so there's a wonderful hippopotamus sprite and scratch that these girls fell in love with so they made their own physical hippopotamus to control it and then on the lower right uh it was and you know again you can see all the different physical materials they were using and they brought in a little stuffed animals that one of them had from home so again it was bringing something very personal to them and we love when kids start with something they really care about so they brought in this little stuffed animal they really cared about and then strapped a microbit into the backpack of the animal and then used it to control through an animated story so i think one thing i love about you know the examples of this workshop it also shows the diversity of different types of projects so when kids do things with scratch and microbit we aren't just looking to follow for everyone to follow the same series of instructions like a recipe and then come up with the same project even if the project works well that's not what we're looking for i think you can see here the great diversity of projects that are possible and to us that really is an indicator the kids are expressing themselves creatively uh and we just know that in today's society that ability to think and act creatively is more important than ever uh you know the world is changing so quickly uh the kids are gonna face a never-ending stream of unknown and uncertain situations so this ability to think and act creatively is so important so i think for us we always think about how can we help young people develop as creative thinkers so i just want to show one more image and this is what we call the four guiding principles of creative learning and we call them the four ps projects passion peers and play and i think you can see that from that workshop kids were working on projects based on their passions in collaboration with peers in a playful spirit and we see that's where the best creative learning always happens uh is when they're going through and that's what we always try to do is help kids you know work on projects based on their passions and collaboration with peers in a playful spirit so i think our image of the computer is not kids just sitting there on their own uh and looking at the screen and the solitary experience but connecting with the physical world connecting with other people making all those connections and that's what gets us so excited about the scratch and microbit connection thank you so much mitch for sharing those stories and connecting to the four p's it's really exciting to see examples that we we know exist around the world um and i really love hearing the history that we've had with michael bit foundation so i think it's really important to show that you know we're anchored in this work together and the commitment that we have to making a difference and impacting the world is really important and will make a difference so we're so excited to have this um our presentation our with with everyone here launching out the michael bit a live conference and also would love to introduce elaine atherton to come in and share a little bit we'll chat a little bit before we transition but i thought it would be great to one remind everyone of the work that we've been doing again with the scratch education collaborative it was just a little i would say a little vision of five to eight organizations that we thought we would we have a pilot of a global impact and really in the first year it's turned into elevating the movement that we already have so so excited that michael bit a foundation is part of our partners in this work and again would just like to say hello to elaine we'll chat a bit and then uh elaine you'll take it away good morning shauna and mitch thank you so much it's so exciting to be here and also mitch thank you for the images just a great reminder that when we are trying to push forward and be the catalyst for the change we want to see we really appreciate relationships with organizations like microbit that allow us to be inspired and continue to merge the physical computing world with the digital computing world and when you do those things the possibilities are endless for kids yeah so it really be exciting i know the sec is going to give a great opportunity to greatly expand those opportunities because there's only so much we can do at mit and at the scratch foundation we're working hard to continue to make this creative platform and a great community around it but to really put it into practice or it's going to require efforts from organizations and educators all around the world so it's great the way the sec is helping to support that and to make sure that there's this whole network of educational organizations to put these ideas into practice and really doing the work in the communities i was seeing some of the comments fly it's really exciting thank you thank you thank you everyone who's saying thank you for the work that we're doing but again thank you back to you being in your communities and ensuring that everyday kids have the chance to have creative learning experiences which really makes a difference in how they think about uh the world moving forward so just wanted to give a quick shout out to everyone here with us this morning or this evening or this afternoon a part of our micro bit live conference virtual conference and we really look forward to hearing i know we're going to get a chance now to hear from some of the organizations that are participating in the scratch education collaborative and we always learn so much from hearing about their experiences awesome thank you mitch and shauna hopefully we'll see you around later in a session so want to jump in and just talk a little bit more about the sec before we kick off our panel discussion with our participants um as shawna mentioned the sec is a in our pilot year so it's an initiative that supports and engages organizations in collaborative learning um and also connects them with partners in the scratch organization as well as outside of the scratch organization um so they can enhance their capacity and to learn more about equitable creative coding um there is a it's a two-year engagement um where and it's a cohort experience where we support organizations um as they participate in workshops they participate in forums and chats and they also have the opportunity for one-on-one um development and conversations with the sec liaison that really helps them to hone in on the development of a resource a equitable creative coding resource that they will use to support the work that they're doing currently we have 41 organizations in our pilot year 41 organizations across six continents it is a very very diverse group from large-scale organizations all the way to even just independent schools and school districts we really could not have asked for a better group honestly to really partner with for this year it's just been so dynamic um one of the things i really want to highlight is our vision i'm going to share anytime we switch to share we always want to cross our fingers for a moment let's see here all right so i just briefly want to highlight um our vision for the sec um when we were putting together this experience we realized it was important for us to create a vision that was focused on eliminating gaps in access and opportunities to creative computing also to realign our focus to ensure that we are serving marginalized communities in collaboration with the organizations that are working directly with those local areas and regions and also to create a scalable model that focused on equitable creative coding today you're going to hear from three organizations that participate in the sec um we're so excited to continually engage these organizations and they have just been so phenomenal in um just really singing our praises but we are so much more grateful for them um to be able to learn from them and to be able to partner with them in this work i'm going to go ahead and let them introduce themselves so if we can be joined here we are all right so we'll kick it off with rosa rosa if you don't mind introducing yourself yes thank you so much elaine thank you everyone here at the microwave live this is awesome my name is rosaristi and i am with bridges to science we offer innovative math coding and robotics clubs and workshops for hispanics homeschoolers and other underserved communities we we're based in houston texas and we're just so happy to be here thank you rosa i'm gonna pass it to marco hi uh my name is marco tullio uh i am a product manager in brazil government uh i.t service provider i also a member of the brazilian creative learning network and i am volunteer and action partners uh action partners is a social and educational project that operates in the northern region of brazil more precisely in the city of santa barbara in state of para it's a small poor and remote community in the middle of the amazon we work with teachers children between 6 and [Music] 12 years and have history starts to work with young people between 16 and 80 years old well thank you marco and we're going to kick it over to rishi thank you elaine uh hey everyone my name is rishi and i anchor uh tech and computational thing tinkering aspect for the school school ecosystem of west alliance we are based out of bangalore uh india our our work is in transforming learning ecosystems across the school to work uh continuing with with key levers like ed tech capacity building partnership and advocacy um our work spans across the middle schools uh secondary schools and the technical and vocational education you know landscape in india and i think uh in terms of outreach we we are currently working with around six uh 1600 plus public schools and within which impacting around four lakh plus students and majority of them are from the underserved communities um and and this is all been done in partnership with with uh almost 10 civil uh society partners across nine states in the country so yeah and that's where i think scratch comes in uh as part of computational thinking thank you thank you rishi um so to even follow up on something mitch mentioned earlier in the keynote uh really focusing on collaborations and partnerships and how microbit has been such a vital partner to scratch over the years we really took the essence of that idea and that messaging in how we approach the development of the scratch education collaborative um the sec is only as good as the partners and with our partnerships with our participants like you um rishi just piggybacking on something you just said how does your work um and the work of your organization align with the sec vision to provide access and opportunities in equitable creative coding yeah uh thank you ellen i think uh uh i'll before starting i think i'll just like to give a bit of context before we get into how it aligns i think when we talk about underserved communities our major focus is with the girl child within the public school ecosystem across nine states so i think uh our our gender focused interventions are designed in a way that it helps them to kind of you know counter gender biases in their career choices and hence i think we work in building those critical 21st century skills uh particularly you know for them to be able to pursue higher education particularly in stem fields and here i think the focus is to build critical mindsets and not just being limited to those four subjects because then it becomes kind of limiting in certain ways so uh i think that's where uh it becomes very important to build those mindsets and here i think what is very important to also kind of uh you know very very cognizant of how what is the context we recently we did a survey and i think the findings were really really eye-opening we we reach out to almost 100 plus students around 100 teachers 30 parents i think gender biases this gendered perception of abilities of the student at least here in this country i think teachers also view students as mostly consumers and not active creators or where they're tinkering et cetera et cetera and i think if anyone wants to i mean i can post a link uh and it is also available on a website but i quickly wanted to just jump in here to say that i think that's where it is very important that there's an immediate need to build mindsets and attitudes uh when particularly when our work is with with the underserved and marginalized communities and when i when i think of our work and sec's commitment to access and opportunities uh with respect to equitable uh computing i think both the scratch platform and the workshop the sec workshop that have been we have gone through uh i think it takes care of everything it it actually uh builds uh a very very um you know a kind of level playing field whether it's a platform where you have diversity of sprites you are able to create your own sprites or you know where you create a sprite just bring break those gender stereotypes and i think that's that's the power of the platform uh where they are not just building uh you know learning something programming but they're also building mindsets and if i have to talk from an sec perspective i think it's very important uh to also see how we are approaching i think one of the key takeaways for us is that what is this entire pedagogy of you know getting into computational thinking and i think it it it does talks to how do we make it culturally relevant and you know so i think that that also enables access equity not just in terms of infrastructure but also how do you deliver it i think these are so many alignments that i can think of and i think all these workshops have actually opened our eyes in in uh in certain ways and also we see the alignments yeah thank you mindsets are so important especially when um you want to make sure that your the kids you're working with understand that creative coding is it's not just scratch it's creative coding it's playful learning it's building different skills in a digital world and also having those skills to make them transferable when you're also working with other tools such as microbit just curious uh marco can you tell us a little bit about how your organization is using microbits to help kids continue to imagine and create and share their work okay uh we work with a lot of resources and and we have a lack of basic things in in this community because it's very poor very remote then you use a lot of um to get activities we for example we use blocks and we do the blocks of the scratch in cardboard and they play in physical road first and because we have a lack of computers a lack of technical stuffs then we need to try more physical things because of the slack the hedgehog is very limited in offer uh cultural shooters for kids we don't have museums we don't have libraries then with the pandemic uh with these schools our closets the kids uh is on the the streets uh in receiving the influence of drug dealers and another things it's a violence regime too you know it's um very difficult to to work interest in this challenge uh scenario but uh technologies like scratch and like microbeads we can show uh for these kids they can imagine they can work with another scenarios we can work with unknown voters realities put these kids in connection with older kids from the country we have we work a lot with partners because we have to offer some basic things for example like food for for some families then we need to to work with partners every day it's because the name is action partners uh we use um micro beach for activities like work workshops we with workshops for teachers because uh the traditional education don't prepare teachers for use technology or go out for specific modes and we need to to show the teachers uh these tools like scratch and microbeads then we do workshops and these workshops is a way to to bring money and bring another resources for the organization the organization it's very small uh it starts with one guy in the streets talking with the kids and uh we now we are trying to expand it for another states and brazil thank you marco i love the name of marco's organization action partners because really what we see with so many of the organizations connected with scratches it really is we're taking action we're trying to um mobilize and be so as supportive as possible of i know our partners in uh bridges to science and houston texas definitely um are doing some exciting work with micro bits as well to support kids in their imagining and creating and sharing rosa can you tell us a little bit more about that oh sure well um we um started out offering our coding clubs right before the pandemic so as in many other organizations we had to adapt quickly and one thing we found that while our students love you know learning how to program they for our virtual sessions they would benefit from something that they could touch and feel with their hands so um we were we're really excited that we brought in microbeads to our coding club sessions this year and it has been amazing because students can create things uh almost from like day one they use scratch we get a lot of our students have never had exposure to coding and they just feel very empowered that they can do something that it's meaningful it's playful and it's fun for them um and we we really uh enjoy it and let me tell you on day one this was like a great experience our students um we have one student who has done a lot of scratch calling so everybody looks up to him and he share a project that he did with sounds but likewise one student who had never done um anything with micro bit or scratch he brought in and shared his project and he was equally as happy so at that moment we knew we had a winning equation because it was it's about bringing access to them to uh wherever they're at whether they have had some experience or whether they have had none so it has been very empowering for our students and they love microbead to the point that the other day one of our students um made a game that is using scratch but the micro bit is acts as the controller so they could move and they call it the hungry snake or something like that so it was a an impromptu and the student said look i have this to share i want to let you all know how you can do it and how you can adapt this scratch project to do things like this and i was expecting that maybe just a couple of the suicide told them well you can continue i'll stay with you all and and the tas were willing uh long story short the majority of the classes stay past the hour for another half an hour to explore these projects so this goes to tell you in an age where our students are like fatigue of virtual meetings just to see that kids are excited and they were participating and wanting to learn um i really feel very privileged that they think of our sessions that way but i think it's because of how they can create and imagine using scratch and microbial and these technologies that are meaningful to them thank you rosa rishi i saw some great uh images that you shared of the girls um just tinkering and doing different things can you share a little bit more about uh some of your organization quest alliance's work um with your kids and micro bit yeah absolutely i think uh we have just started uh so i think one is this one is this entire vision that we have another is also uh we have just finished certain trainings and i think uh first i'll give a bit of how how it looks like i think we have this we offer first we under the umbrella of computational thinking we offer creative computing experiences via scratch for all our secondary school students i think but i think there's one curriculum that we have just uh built and we are piloting it is the advanced coding curriculum where we are there there's a lot of focus on uh you know hardware integration and microbit becomes an important aspect uh in that sense and i think for us the goal is twofold here i think one is this bringing in pure tinkering uh experiences uh because in in the process of making just a final output the the entire aspect of process gets gets very underestimated so what is this aspect of messing up uh totally takes a back seat i think that's one goal that we have and another is that how do we uh amalgamate and with our currently problem solving solving approaches which we which are very integrated to our curriculum processes like ideathons and hackathons so what if uh you know if if uh out of an ideathon they have come up with an idea how do we kind of use hardware integration to kind of you know uh you know uh build certain things uh certain solutions and and what we have clearly seen in our initial trainings that uh this entire you know the amalgamation of uh you know digital digital computing with physical has has got a lot of you know traction uh particularly in the virtual setup as we talked we just finished one training and results have been uh tremendous people are building apps around the uh around what also may professor snake talk about is around passion which means something that they really care about and they have come up with various you know variations and some great artifacts so i think uh that way uh it's it's a great uh tool in the hands of both our facilitators and students yeah i always say that um we think adults we think we come up with a great idea and then you just get a a handful of kids that just kick your idea to the side because it's so much more creative and so much more innovative um we're all they truly are the future in pushing the ideas forward and i think our biggest responsibility is how do we serve as um great conduits how are we just a great facilitator of allowing that exploration and allowing kids to make those connections um one thing i'm really curious about is the idea of transformation and especially where we are still in the pandemic we are still in a uh where a lot of our communities are struggling a lot of kids are still struggling and trying to find ways to connect and still remain um creative so thinking about that how do you see organizations like scratch and microbit helping to transform the way kids are learning in your communities and the communities that you serve in the future marco yes uh we use the this technology to provide more creativity and critical thinking for the kids because we see the the youngers when you give the space for for him express yourself they have difficulties because in the in the traditional school it's more released than to talk and uh they don't have this practice they have difficult to chewing machine little kids know little kids and look for the the the tools and and start to work you don't need to to explain but um adults and and youngers they will uh wait for the the institutions to to to work then uh we see in our spaces that we uh our bases in the computer clubhouse and the four piece of creative learning and we see this transformation and the people who start to think and do uh what they want uh what is your patience um it's for for us it's the the most important because uh we have um great caps and brazil great diversity but when you put some but people together and started to to work in the project uh this difference disappear and it just is a flow of creativity things it's a very grateful tool to see when it's work and uh micro micro buy at micro beach it's very uh interesting for it because it's a little board with a lot of resources then it's uh the the the kids the teachers uh every everyone knows uh for us it's a little uh just a little problem it's the price uh here in brazil technology it's very expensive um when we import uh technology have a lot of tax we need to pay and here it's three times expensive martin united states for example then it's uh um difficult for for us but uh we know we have a partnership of the scratch foundation with a brazilian company positive and we have an expectation to see the price lower in the future thank you that is a legitimate concern especially i think those concerns have been amplified with the pandemic for a lot of different resources even just being able to get resources especially as we're trying to remain optimistic and forward and future thinking as well rosa uh yes um well um we foresee uh our communities in particular one of them access is a big issue and um they um i don't even like to talk much about them because i get sort of a joke usually but they don't have access to computer at home the majority um when i asked a class of 20 how many had had experience with scratch three of them so i think only three said they had and i think something has to change and at bridges to science we're trying to create the ecosystem and we're so grateful for sec and all the organizations that generally want to help us because it's a big job and we cannot even for the most enthusiastic organizations like ours we can do this alone and our children need it um they they're just so curious and talented you know when i brought them uh this micro bit um i i was i i teach a workshop on binary arithmetic that um opens their eyes to children like how math is in computing um but um usually that takes them an hour to grasp but with a microbead you know i said well let me just mention that those slides you know leds and rgbs and i was amazed at how just by holding the micro bead and and doing an exercise they quickly grasped that concept you know um it was just so encouraging um they have so much potential so many children even those that have never had access you would think well i need to they're just eager for this and they're ready and they're so capable and curious and and excited that if only they just um have access so we're just so grateful for how scratch makes this technology accessible meaningful and they can imagine and create and just the future is bright it's really bright um and i am thankful for all the ssc organizations and all we are learning so that we can better serve our students thank you we're getting close to the end of our time but i do um want to just pass it to rishi for a moment just to hear a little bit about how do you see how when you're thinking of the future in the communities that you're serving what does scratch and bit look like as a part of that transformation to you i think uh just i think i won't repeat the costing which and rosa's concerned on the access to the infrastructure because i think that's that's the problem across india as well and i think if i have to just throw numbers i think that that looks very decimal so i won't get into that but i think uh what what scratch and micro bit kind of enables is is you know i think they offer very low floors which means that students get to have the making experience tinkering experience instantly and thereby you know creating again again equity uh so that you know uh computational thinking or coding is not just uh limited or there is no hierarchy of subjects it it actually creates a very good level think field and we have seen this very clearly but i think what has been striking for me has been is that how it has also approached uh change our approach the pedagogical approaches to coding which has been very very at least in our country uh given the setup that we are and the mental makeup that we are i think it's primarily very very instructivist in nature and sometimes we have to be but how do we change it to make it a little more you know constructive constructivist where we see uh you know uh uh i think essentially we see for them uh you know being able to design opportunities uh and you know think with their hands and you know hence bringing in this entire uh in order to you know bringing this entire aspect of head heart and hand in their knowledge construction process which which is which is i think very important uh when we when we see the future otherwise it will be it can become any other coding uh experience but as as mitch said that it is a movement so how do we kind of uh you know build that movement uh and i think both the platforms are offering that uh segue into the movement yeah absolutely so as we come to a close um you just hit set me up with the perfect uh tee off um rishi where we want to continue this movement we our applications are open for our next cohort our 2022-2023 cohort um and we also have information sessions we are facilitating on december 10th so if you want to take a quick picture for the qr code it'll take you to our events page to register and you can also visit our website and view our application and frequently ask questions i thank you all again for just this experience and allowing us to be here you've got 30 some more hours of um programming and so we look forward to seeing all of you later thank you bye thank you everyone thank you and we've got the link dropped into the comments just for uh our webpage as well we're going to go ahead and pass it back over and yes thank you again
