micro:bit LIVE 2021 | A sprint through graphing & data collection options

uh okay everyone see my screen okay okay so i'm going to do kind of a quick sprint through some of the graphing and data collection options um so first off just a little bit of context about why i'm doing this so um i work at a university i teach university level classes and uh we have outreach programs and largely in science um so i was working with our school partnership programs and they were interested in doing some data measurements some temperature collection over time and uh i i worked with them to develop some modules to make the uh micro bit do this i apologize for just a second there um so they have this one particular experiment i'm gonna do kind of a quick run through uh some of the highlights of it uh as soon as the video loads sorry about that i thought that was already queued up um yeah there we go okay so the goal here is to figure out whether uh mass impacts absorption of temperature and i'm just going to kind of scrub through a couple of highlights here so they collect data using the micro bit and they show the impact of temperature on two different samples as they're exposed to light and as they're absorbing heat so by using the micro bit they were able to graph this out and make it really visual and uh really really uh kind of focused on real time okay um they provide complete instructions for how to set up that experiment i'll be happy to share that with anyone who might be interested so let's talk a little bit about some of the different options that are available for graphing in the micro bit so you can log data to the micro bit and store it locally on the micro bit or you can stream it you can do uh wired versus wireless streaming uh and there are different environments that support uh data collection and graphing in different ways so the make code environment and the moot editor for python works slightly differently um so i want to give kind of an overview of uh a little bit of each of these and a quick demo of one or two of them so uh the idea of logging is where you save the data on the micro bit itself so there's some strengths and weaknesses to logging um one of the real strengths is you can deploy a micro bit for data collection and maybe leave it out on the playground collecting the temperature data for an entire day and night so you can kind of see how the temperature changes with sunlight some of the cons though are that there's a limited amount of memory on micro bits and if you're trying to collect data in multiple ways like for that experiment we just saw that was collecting data from two temperature sensors it can be difficult to synchronize that data if you have multiple micro bits okay um so uh microbit.org has kind of an overview of how to do data logging with the micro bit using their newly added logging library um so the basic idea is you set up your your kind of columns of data you indicate temperature and light is the two things that are collecting here and and then you use a log data block in order to actually collect that uh so that's one of the options that's available um so let's move on so i'm going to focus the rest of my time on the idea of streaming so uh streaming streams data in real time pros and cons so it's responsive so the example we saw was an example of uh streaming can handle lots of data one of the downsides is in some cases a little bit more setup is needed so you've got kind of two major options for streaming you can do a wired over a usb connection doesn't require batteries easy to set up and make code not much red tape and there are a couple of examples here in the uh micro bit org site of how to set this up um i'm gonna do a really really quick demo of that uh so i'm just gonna go to uh make code i'm going to set up a really really really quick example here of streaming so i've already got an acceleration block here i'm going to add in a couple of these serial blocks where i write values so i'm going to write the x value so this kind of is the column that i'm going to be right into and the actual data in my simulator it's already showing the simulated data with my simulated micro bit as soon as i actually program this on my my physical micro bit i'll be able to see that data streaming there will be a second button that pops up here that shows me the live data from the actual micro bit so with about 20 seconds left to go will i make it maybe i'll come back to that in just a second so if you want to create your own websites for collecting your own data i've actually created a javascript library to allow data collection so it allows you to create your own sort of graphing sites i've had a couple of student projects that have gone on and created their own sites okay and so with that i'm going to mention one more thing and then i am going to uh to wrap it up because i'm at the end of my time uh two more things rather uh so i've also created a kind of a quick tutorial on how to stream over bluetooth this isn't very well suited for classroom because of the amount of setup and also the microbit site has a collection of resources on how to do remote data collection where two micro bits stream the data a little bit easier to deal with than uh than uh bluetooth and allows collection from multiple uh sensors okay so with that i think i hit my five minute mark bill you did wonderful sort of phil uh feel rushed there you've uh you've filled mines yet again uh rayna built igor thank you so much for your demos uh today sharing that i see a lot of those links ended up in the the chat uh bill if uh if you want a quick please define you where do they go oh uh so i will uh receiver gmail.com to contact me by email and uh later today i will uh post the slides with all the links i i used at my personal website siever.info excellent thank you so much
