i have a little presentation and as she mentioned my name is amanda dinard and i'm from texas i'm a digital learning specialist for umbilisd and my main focus as a digital learning specialist is to bring coding into all classrooms is this yeah because i believe that coding is for everybody and there's been a big push to bring computer science through to all education areas but i what i'm seeing a lot is specifically high school in the united states our numbers are about 48 percent of all high schools offer computer science however what i find interesting is only about five percent of students are actually enrolled in these computer science courses so although we're making big strides we're still not reaching all the people not to mention their huge disparities and um and under representation from many populations from women to african americans and hispanic populations so i think that we need to prioritize equity and diversity to get everybody included and i think that involves four steps and the first is starting early it's determined that by fourth grade students know children know if computer science or coding is for them or not they tend to generalize stereotypes around the subject when they're not exposed to it early so starting them early allows everyone to believe that they too can be a part of the computer science world the second is reach everybody sometimes what happens is the coding and computer science gets pushed to the gt or gifted and talented type students or it gets pushed to a kind of extra fun hour after our activities are done and or even the hour of code which is a great initiative but just one hour of coding isn't isn't quite enough i think it's time for more the third is to empower teachers teachers have so much on their plate and if you ask them okay now you're going to teach coding too that could seem quite overwhelming but with all of the things that are out there now easing in things like scratch can be done for teachers in the content areas and then the fourth is promoting purpose so we're not just learning how to code we're learning through code and in our school district we have an um i've run a program called coding and beyond and it consists of about 50 teachers throughout the district that are dedicated to bringing coding into their classroom outside of just our standard computer lab slash computer science classes and we're really found we're really our fundamentals are in community and culture and letting the community and the students know that this is part of what we do and who we are um also capstones and with capstones i mean using project-based learning instead of just little one-off assignments with coding but the biggest pillar that we have is the teachers and again this is that empowerment to let them letting them know and believe that they can do this in their classes and coding is a great place for pbl and this i get from mitch resnick as he spoke yesterday from scratch but the thing about coding is it provides the low floors where it's easy to get started and it has high ceilings so where you could take take it to whatever level you need to so students don't get bored with that because those that are just struggling to get started have a place to be and those that could take it to the left take it to the next level have a place to be without being slowed down and of course wide walls meaning that my program might not look like your program and that's okay there's so many ways we could incorporate this and micro bit is one of my favorite ways to bring project based learning into class because number one it's inexpensive compared to a lot of the other things that are out there so that makes it accessible to more people and more schools two it connects easy it's not too hard to figure out either through microsoft make code or scratch it's easy to pair up and partner and then of course there's limitless possibilities on what you could do with the um with it and so when i present these ideas to teachers i usually have like a three-step process to kind of ease them into how am i going to really do coding and teach everything that there is and so i say to just start with a beginner tutorial and i have some links on my slides a micro bit has lessons that have been created and make uh make code microsoft make code also has several different lessons to let the students get acquainted with how to connect how to upload the code um and once you're comfortable with that then you can level up to some short content related tasks that are a little bit longer or a little bit more independent than the tutorials and finally after they're comfortable have them do as do their own project and create some things um some things that i've seen around my district one that i wanted to highlight was this um i have a thing there a um a history class did when studying the 1920s one of the students did a project on the women's suffrage movement and created a vote voter box and the project wasn't just about creating this voting box um it went beyond that the student also made a had a presentation that they presented with all kinds of information about this time period but also they did a data activity where they planned like a class i want to say it was a class picnic and they chose like where are they going what are they wearing what music what food and there were several different choices and the whole class voted and so what this student did then is divided out the results based on certain groups like if only the male votes were counted this would be the outcome if only the female this would be if only this group so they looked and studied the data through these like terms to really get a grasp on the um the voting movement and so i thought this was kind of cool because um for the teacher they what the feedback i got was you know that it wasn't what they still had so much learning and the actual coding of the micro but it didn't take the whole class period class after class like this long daunting project that the teacher had to put on the students took it upon themselves to add and it added a level of enrichment to the project that they had hey amanda i'm gonna just jump in okay yeah you're up and my little dog is going insane in the background he's loving what you're saying by the way
