all right so yeah i'm as uh as i mentioned before i'm or as was mentioned i'm andrew mcdonald i'm coming from uh gatineau quebec um and uh really excited to be here to to share about uh the journey that i helped my students um for the do your bit challenge all right come on slides my slides didn't have coffee yet in the morning so there we are so uh actually the first thing i wanted to do um is uh be mindful of where we're where we're living so in the spirit of truth and reconciliation we acknowledge that we are hosted here today on the customary and traditional lands of the indigenous people of this territory we recognize the enduring presence of all first nations metis and the inuit people so that's something that i like to do uh before any of my my sessions and i invite you to explore um the indigenous um peoples of your area as well there's one website that i really like uh it's called native land.ca um and it has indigenous um and territories from all over the world um i i don't have it on uh on pace but if someone could could throw that in the chat that'd be awesome uh please and thank you um so as as i said uh i'm in gatineau and i'm on the lands of the algonquin and the anishnabee people so uh i'm going to talk a little bit about the do your bit project i'm sure that you've heard about it over the past couple days or just in the past from your connection and love for the micro bit i'm going to talk a little bit about um the course design that i did with my students so i ran a specific course um that we sort of took uh micro bit uh do your bit and uh engineering design process and sort of mash them all together uh for this wonderful one for these wonderful projects and i'm uh excuse me i'm just gonna highlight one project for today um and uh just because the students were excited to to for me to share their project um but i'd i'd love uh i would have loved to have a whole day to share all of the projects uh that the students went through so a little bit about myself uh so i'm sort of a science or steam i guess you could say uh teacher educator based here in the the gatineau region so gatineau and ottawa uh in in canada and uh as you can see i'm a microbit champion uh really love getting down and dirty with uh physical computing and the the coding aspect so raspberry pi i'm really into that mickey makey all those sorts of things and the two students that i'm gonna highlight today uh they're both in high school uh and they both have interest in exploring and in making and becoming engineers uh so one her passion was math and science uh and is really interested in getting into bio medical mechanical engineering and then another the other student she's really interested in social justice um and so she was really interested in getting into the environmental engineering aspect so again two young and inspiring students uh to to share uh their projects with us today so just as a recap for what is the do your bit challenge so it is sort of bringing together the micro bits as well as the un sustainable development goals those global goals are 17 of the global goals that have been brought together and um they are the goal is that for these 17 goals to be a comp or the target is for uh year 2030 to have um us reach those goals as a global community and so the do your bit challenge is trying to inspire um activities and i'll i'll show a few of those activities or um i'll show the do your bit website uh near the end of my presentation so that you can see where some inspiration comes from uh for the students as sort of getting started um with that so uh for those that you don't know uh what is the microbit so it's a small little device um got a few of them here as i as we all do i'm sure um and it allows students to really explore different aspects of of physical computing as we saw in the presentations during the opening session today and and yesterday and throughout yesterday there's so many different things that you can do with the micro bit um it's really inspiring in terms of like if you if you can think it up there's probably a way that you can somehow connect the micro bit to it um with the onboard buttons with the leds with the ability to uh add added sensors and added connectors as well as the onboard sensors too there's so many things that can that can be done with it and so uh the way that i sort of designed my course is um goes back to this idea of coding to learn and learning to code and now a lot of the students are very maybe very new to to coding in general um never seen anything to do with coding but they were interested in this particular course um and and you know the great course description that i wrote anyway so um the idea was that i introduced them to various parts of the micro bit through little short um tutorials i guess one thing i should mention is this was a virtual course um so it it allowed you know again we can talk a little bit about the pros and the cons to that uh in in the future and i know that the the girls will ha the ladies will highlight that as well but the idea was that i would give them these sort of short tutorials that i developed myself um on using different parts of the the micro bit so i'm sort of introducing the buttons at first something very simple or can be simple i guess um and then the the leds on there getting into some of the onboard sensors so that they can explore that what you know the light sensor temperature sensor um the accelerometer uh the compass those sorts of things and then the idea was for them to with their creativity create these little small projects throughout that and just to show case that they've learned little things and then alongside that we were also learning about the un's sustainable development goals excuse me i'm just going to grab some water so we were learning about all all of the goals i sort of gave uh just you know anybody pick any goal and i wanted you to just make a little small uh poster presentation just a single uh slide uh on a collaborative slide deck and so everybody can see everybody else's work and just to get an idea to for them to start thinking about some of these goals and then the the targets within those goals um and then because the the final goal or the final project was i would want them to use all of their knowledge or try to apply some of their knowledge again they didn't have to use every part of the microbit but use part of the micro bit that they would see fit to go towards one of these global goals that they um ended up focusing on and throughout this time we also talked about the engineering design process i think i have a slide here for yes so we talked about the engineering design process and so through that time we talked about um uh coming up with that identifying that solution or that that problem first is you know one of the those global goals what are they going to focus on and again they were allowed to pick anything they wanted within those global goal parameters which is actually quite extensive and if you actually start to think about what is uh the opportunities there for and then what i did was i had check-ins throughout um their the process just so i can see that they're on task and also for guidance as well um and just see you know like okay so let's brainstorm some solutions and just you know anything that you want just write it down um and then we can start to think about they can start thinking about with their knowledge of the micro bit how can we integrate these things together and some of them were you know really hand in hand it went really really well some of them were a stretch but again that's where we we collaborate we chat about it and the the the students also did little presentations throughout um to get feedback from their peers um and that was sort of the the the fun thing that i enjoyed is that that opportunity to not just have um that sort of me and them having a chat back and forth but they were able to talk about uh things with their peers so that was really great too and then they went through uh and they selected a particular design and then they uh built that and they iterated over that and so um there was actually at least two rounds of iterations that was part that was again part of that design of the course is that i wanted them to show us something again do a little presentation and then with our feedback myself and all of the other students had to give some feedback then they went went back to their virtual desks and worked on that and then they had another presentation at the end to share that out also during this they had to document all of their work and so each of the student groups had these presentations but also a website that they developed and i'll showcase one of the the students website in in a few moments so um but i'm not gonna i you've heard me talk a little bit um but what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna i'm gonna stop talking and i'm gonna let uh the girls talk about the ladies sorry um talk about their presentation so fingers crossed that this can work i didn't see an a thing that allowed me to share my audio but i hopefully it will work can can you hear the audio if someone can just not yet um if you did you when you shared uh andrew uh i think i might have to re-share andrew can you hear me okay sorry about that hey andrew hi yeah i if you just share there's a little button that will say share audio and um before you share it uh on what the thing that when when it pop pops up i don't see that i see entire screen when so if i click on window on the right side on the bot on the left side on the bottom share system audio [Music] let's try this again you mean like there's supposed to be a little check box on what to when it says what to share uh there's share tab audio when i do a chrome tab but when i do window there's no nothing there okay then it might not be set up with your system or for permissions andrew um okay let's try this again can you are you able to see the yeah fully can see your screen okay we we almost hear it but it's like almost not there very very low i think it might just be coming from your headset [Music] poop all right uh [Music] can we pause for a minute i think i i'm i'm running a little fast so i think i have a little bit of time choose okay with other this is the you didn't come here to hear me speak you came here to hear the students so um all right would it be in is it a youtube link andrew is it available on youtube uh it's not um it's just on my oh maybe i can play it from okay sorry it's they sent it to me through a uh through drive so i wonder if they can if i can google drive maybe i can share it in a tab that might work i was hoping that downloading it would you know i wouldn't have to worry about that stuff and i remember asking that to you when you know saying that i was going to share some stuff and you said yeah there's like a little check box and perfect great and then yeah all right sorry about that everyone no worries all right how am i doing for time anyway you have um 18 minutes okay perfect yeah let me confirm that yes you have 18 minutes all right let's uh yeah that's worse that's a good idea good yeah i love everybody in chat right how are you having yeah um all right let's see videos okay share audio tab all right kyle you don't want to hear me you want to hear them that's why you're here okay let's see and well it's not as big as i wanted it to be but but at least you'll hear that's the that's the most important thing i think is here and it'll be bigger once i leave i just want to make sure we can hear it we can't see it right now yeah yeah okay you can't see it right now since this presentation as much of the course the bit challenge as a way of teaching about competency and engineering we wanted to talk about why we took this course in the first place much of that had to do with the fact that we were two students very much interested in going into engineering so we really wanted to experience the field as part of that field we wanted to actually experience the engineering design process and go through the motions of creating something especially something technology-based obviously much of this technology-based work and design has to do with coding and engineering so we really wanted to build our coding skills so we both came across this course and found it to be a great way to do both and in reading this course description we saw there was a mention of using these engineering concepts and skills and the design process to find solutions to issues facing our world as two younger people who are very involved in social media and are seeing these discussions surrounding social justice we always feel so helpless and ask what can we do but we also have always regarded engineers as problem solvers so in seeing this course and actually being offered a way to help through using these skills we were so interested in gaining was very intriguing and it was through this experience of going through the engineering design process and learning to code and being presented with the global goals that we were able to create our project the microcosm awesome all right uh so let's go to the next one yeah so that was their little description of sort of why why they took it took the course and then they're gonna talk a little bit about their their process the purpose of the microcom was to help individuals who struggle with their mental health cope with any potential symptoms that they may have we wanted it to be discreet and easy to use at any time the individual felt it would help we also wanted it to be relatively generic so that it could be accessible by anyone that needed it in order to accomplish our goal there are a variety of functions that we designed that thought would help with different types of symptoms for example we included an emotions check-in which was used as a grounding technique or an anchor for those who have trouble putting their emotions into words we also wanted to include box breathing which is a technique that is meant to calm an individual and allow them to focus on something if they find they're having trouble concentrating we also included a fidget toy which acts as something discreet that they can play with to keep them on track finally we included a game which allows someone who needs to escape from any invading thoughts and use it as an outlet to reduce their overall stress so as we talk about the microcom and its components and we actually have a picture here to the right of our original paper prototype that originally was indicating how we planned on using all of our buttons and sensors to make these components work although there have been some revisions since then and that's all part of the engineering design process as we talk about these components and how they address mental health we can ask and answer the question of how we landed on mental health and more specifically what global goal this project was based on this project specifically was inspired by global goal number three good health and well-being but we decided to address the lesser talked about or thought out part of our health our mental health when we think about how the well-being we often think exclusively of the physical part but mental health is an incredibly vital part of a person's overall well-being we particularly landed on this because of all the conversations we as individuals and as a society are starting to take part in those running mental health not only that but we also recognize the many newfound struggles people were facing with their mental health due to the pandemic and increased isolation as well as the increase of stressors in our lives so as part of the problem identification step of our engineering design process we took inspiration from the global goals and the world around us and settled on addressing mental health so as we talk about the microcom and its components and we actually have a picture here to the right of our original paper prototype originally was indicating how we planned on using all of our buttons and sensors to make these components work although there have been some revisions since then and that's all part of the engineering design process

when we think about how the well-being we often think exclusively of the physical part but mental health is an incredibly vital part of a person's overall well-being we particularly landed on this because of all the conversations we as individuals and as a society are starting to take part in surrounding mental health not only that but we also recognize the many newfound struggles people were facing with their mental health due to the pandemic and increased isolation as well as the increase of stressors in our lives so as part of the problem identification step of our engineering design process we took inspiration from the global goals and the world around us and settled on addressing mental health as with anything this course had its ups in his stones some things that weren't so great about it were the fact that we were taking it online due to the pandemic which proved to be a little challenging because we were never actually able to use a microbit we only ever saw the code that we made on a software the scope of the course also required us to use block code which was a little difficult to use at times especially because we have limited experience with coding prior to the course and that required us to learn how to code as we made this project we were also doing this course alongside our other school work because it was organized outside of our school boards and this brought up a couple time management problems because we had multiple things due in multiple courses on the other side the online format actually did have its benefits my partner and i are from two completely different sides of the city and two completely different school boards this course and the fact that it was online brought us together so that we could bring you microcom and although we did have little experience with the code the microbit software is actually really easy to use and learn which made the process a lot more enjoyable overall mr mcdonald also provided us with many supplementary activities that related to many features on the micro bit which allowed us to easily explore its capabilities and we could actually implement these into our project finally the time that we spent working on the project actually allowed us to discover how much we enjoy the software and how we can use it to tackle real world problems we were able to get creative and work with the engineering design process to make something that we really care about that involved issues that we face in our lives all right so those were a few little videos just to to talk about their process um and and as they went through um through this and i wanted them to also share with you know what they liked and what they didn't like because it's always nice um as an educator i like getting feedback too from my students how did i do how can i improve those sort of things teaching to me is just like in is an iterative process as well um so it's always nice to to go through uh and reflect do try to try to get that uh an opportunity to reflect on that i know uh it's maybe not so easy uh now during the pandemic and we're being asked to all these things um but it's always nice to have a little reflection for ourselves on on how we did uh and those sort of things so uh one of the couple of things that i really liked what they had talked about is um the fact that like and and i feel it's it's a pro and a con sort of that virtual setting they could be part of it um and you know they didn't have to to get together um in a previous uh iteration of the course i had a student join from turkey so it was really great to have you know people from all over the world could could join in and and take that uh but the downside to that is they didn't get uh the physical micro bits um until uh i and so when when these uh when these ladies decided that they were gonna um so they they took this uh project that they had created for the course and then at near the end of the course i introduced the do your bit challenge to everyone um you know and if they wanted to uh to submit their project uh i'd be more than willing to to support that and you know if there's anything else in addition that they wanted to do then let's do it sort of thing and so one of the girls said it'd be nice to see it on a physical micro bit and i was like yeah no problem so i drove to their house and i gave them a micro bit um all with social distancing et cetera and so they were able to explore it actually on the micro bit all right so i am going to uh be quiet for now i'm going to show you they've got a little demo video here for us so i just wanted to have a little reflection on that and then we'll do a demo video and then i'm going to show their website okay let's make this nice and big for you on start the micro chroma asks user if they would like to check in or not and the checking is going to be a series of emotions that scroll across the led matrix that asks the user to identify exactly how they're feeling and so the user would like to check in then they will shake the microcom which will be recognized by the accelerometer and will lead them into the check-in if the user would not like to check in then they can just do nothing and the microcom will naturally move into the state in which the user can pick any of the coping mechanisms that they would like by pressing any of the buttons and so once the user has selected for check-in the check-in will start but before the check-in starts we have included a little reminder that the microcom is not a replacement for genuine help and in light of that we have included a mental health crisis hotline so the user can call that if they really need to talk to someone once we scrolled through the mental health crisis hotline we'll start scrolling through different sorts of emotions and so if the user wants the emotion scrolls across the screen doesn't identify with it if they do not identify with the emotion on screen then they will just do nothing if the user does identify with the emotions on the screen like this user will identify with nervous they will tilt the logo towards them so they will tilt the logo up which will also be recognized by the accelerometer and so in light of that the microcom will suggest a coping mechanism they do not have to choose his coping mechanism and the letter is going to correlate to what button we suggest they should press which will lead them to the mechanism that we suggest they should use as they do take the advice of the micro com and use your button b they will be led to a fidget spinner which is going to spin naturally and to speed it up like you do a real fidget spinner you can press pin one and then the magic spinner will naturally slow down and so you can continue that cycle of using it like a real fidget spinner and speeding it up and slowing it down and so at any time the user can choose to switch it between the different coping mechanisms in this instance the user chose to press buttons a plus b which is going to be our space invaders s game where player moves along the bottom row and tries to not let any that come down from the top of the screen hit them or hit the bottom of the screen and so they can move right by pressing 2 and move left by pressing 1 and they can press pin 0 to shoot rockets up to destroy enemies the user will have 10 lives and upon losing all those 10 lies they can just press buttons a plus b again to play again or they can press buttons a or b to move into a different coping mechanism but even in the middle of the game the user can press a different button to move into a different coping mechanism in this instance if the user were to press button a they would be moved into our box breathing which is going to indicate to the user how long they should hold their breath as the leds move up the square how long they should hold their breath as it moves across the square on top how long they should breathe out as it moves down the square to the right and how long they should hold that lack of breath across as it moves across the bottom of the square there and to speed up that breathing because the leds are currently lighting up in one second increments to speed up those increments they can press one to slow them down they can press 2 and to return it to the normal one second increment they can press 0. again the user can move through any variety of coping mechanisms at any time to suit their needs we also have up here a link to a website that we created that talks all about the microcom on this website there is a lot more detail and information about the microcom exactly what it is why we created it and how it will help communities we even have an entire tab here detailing our entire engineering design process all in all that is the micro comp so thank you so much for listening to us students today talk about our project and our experience with the course and the dearborn challenge we really did enjoy getting to learn so much in the course and then apply it in a project that we were very passionate about so we hoped you enjoyed hearing about it as much as we did creating it thank you awesome all right so um i will uh drop the microcom website there for you uh in the chat so you can definitely go ahead and explore that i was given the two minute warning so i will um i think what i'll do uh is i'm gonna just quickly go on to their site um and uh address or just show show a little bit uh of that if that's a possibility um a couple questions in the chat already uh one was about how long did i have with the students we had about if i remember correctly um i think it was 11 or 12 hour and a half sessions if i remember correctly so a sort of a decent amount of time to really get into and explore these sorts of things all right is it coming up i don't see it on my screen well if it doesn't come up again i put it in the chat there oh there it is yeah it's just slow it's slow i'm slow it's all right um but yeah so you can sort of get a better idea yeah again it's in the chat so you can you can definitely uh check it out when you uh when you have a chance i know that we're we're packed full of goodness today so um yeah um but and then the the uh the do your bit uh website i want to showcase this in the last 10 seconds probably is a chock full of some great resources for you to get started again if you're not sure where where to get started um this has got some great introductory activities to highlight some of the aspects of the micro bit giving you ideas on what are some of the global goals that are coming up and um just a note the competition is back in january of 2022 so this going hand in hand with the the new cpd that's coming out uh this is gonna be exciting for uh years to come so again thanks very much for everyone uh i'm gonna go back to my presentation and thank you andrew i just wanted to say that was a great presentation and especially with all of the student testimonials that you had put through it i think that really makes a difference in for helping us connect it i also want to say a huge shout out to the audience that has been participating and has been really giving great comments andrew so really appreciate your presentation there um next up everybody is the lightning talk so all you have to do is please click leave session and return to the sessions area um and tab to move on to your next session for awesomeness that can continue and i hope we hope you have a great micro bit live event andrew thank you so much for your time and your dedication to the work thank you very much
