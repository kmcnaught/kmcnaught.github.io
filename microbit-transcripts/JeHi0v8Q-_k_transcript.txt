good morning good morning um i'm not by myself uh from riverview high in canada i'm here with some students and they're actually on their day off um they were here last night until about eight o'clock at night getting ready for this and now they're here bright and early in the morning on their day off to keep your presentation so uh we'll let it go from here that's you okay we are super excited to present dnr a project combining biology physics um computer science and graphic design so the fourth industrial revolution is going to present problems and wonderful opportunities that we can't even think of it's true that we can google how many tons of co2 are going into the atmosphere how many people are going hungry every day how many people are um you know struggling to move around the world to find a better life but google is not going to be able to tell us how to solve climate change how to feed the hungry and what to do with our human migration issue students are going to need to have a diverse set of experiences that they can draw upon to come up with creative solutions to never seen before questions we're going to need a renaissance education and so this art project is a chance for my students to gather from da vinci and the renaissance and look into the future and so how can we create a trans-disciplinary experience for our students well we thought about doing an interactive art piece that would involve coding and some physics and some biology the colored links represent a small portion of nucleic based pairs in a sequence of dna a motion center will detect student movement in a hallway a microbit will do some math with position and velocity look up our dna la and move the light switch students human will act like a scroll bar to circle through the dna light show so thanks to micro bit in its software it made coding easy for anyone for someone with no coding experience they were able to hop in right away and drag and drop blocks if you're someone with more code and experience like myself you're able to code in the language of your choice as seen in the photo here using microbit really helped our project and the possibilities are really endless the ultrasonic sensor we use does more than just sense the presence of people but also gives us distance and velocity using sound waves the microbit sonar extension allowed us to skip past some of the math and physics around echolocation these are some of our beginning thoughts on ways we could code the project so biology and chemistry and of this human living thing that we have is so amazing it's a the coolest machine out there um and so how can we get some of this mystery and intrigue to a whole variety of students and so we've been able to study things like mystery of dna and protein synthesis and so now we have people who are focusing on coding now also think about dna we have people who are thinking about dna thinking about coding and those kinds of things we also have our physics we got our leds and so we have to worry about color addition with the different colors excuse me um we need to think about position time graphs and velocity time graphs a little bit of calculus thrown in there and then we have to worry about waves and reflection and echolocation so we put all those things together the coding the chemistry and the physics and we end up with these beautiful led rings that represent some dna and so late last night we were just here last night working on this got a little video to show you so that that's true so that means if we did have it in a hallway yeah we just kept having people walk by that would keep it or is this i think so once the lights were soldered it was just a matter of putting them together in the right spot so they were transmitting and sending data properly so they would all light up it was a bit tedious because you have to test every single ring but in the end it worked out here's our logos uh from the top right uh left corner and going clockwise you see the um where we started and then where we kind of ended up with our logo being the bottom left logo while working on the rings we had to be careful about where we placed our solder and wires because it is so easy to make mistakes we had to use our fine motor skills to look closely and work out what we were doing and while it was frustrating we realized we did something wrong but it's worth it when it worked this is just the beginning of our project and there's stuff we want to improve upon in the future some of this includes extending the number of rings and solving some of our power issues as well thank you this has been fun let's keep in touch and there we have our quick little lightning round i think we made it in time just in time
