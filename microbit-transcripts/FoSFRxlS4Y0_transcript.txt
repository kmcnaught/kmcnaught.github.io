micro:bit LIVE 2021 | How to use micro:bit classroom with learners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="FoSFRxlS4Y0
thank you for that great introduction i did fill in all that bio which is good um right so yeah i'm from the uk if you haven't already guessed from my accent um and so this is uh so we're going to just basically talk about uh micro bit classroom so i'm hoping that everyone here of course um has maybe heard of it a little bit but of course it's here to sort of have a go and basically we're going to do a live demo of this i'm actually going to show you how to do it and you're going to be students in my classroom and we're going to have a go and you're going to see what it looks like from a student point of view and i'm going to show you from the teacher point of view okay just so you know why i occasionally look to my left i've got more than one screen so i'm presenting in a few different ways um there the links that link will go to this slide deck which i will share with you at the end if you're very quick on making notes you of course can take that down but i am going to share a slide deck with you but most of this session will be live okay so this is why i really like micro bit pop class and this has happened during uh the lockdown that of course many schools have been involved in and during the lockdown in england we of course worked remote learning completely and one of the things that i was lucky enough to do was i managed to send microbes out to some of my students in my school but then we used microbit class which was still quite new then it was quite early and i was using it remotely with children in order in order to teach them um but also see what they're doing and look at their code that's something that's really interesting about what microcast we actually do because sometimes you want to be able to grab a sample what the kids are doing of course you walk around the room but of course this allows you to grab it and actually get real um good evidence so you know what children have actually accomplished in the lesson because sometimes especially certain children i'm talking with primary age children so we're talking up to age 11. sometimes maybe they don't necessarily capture everything they need to and present that to you in a way that's easy to understand whereas this tool can allow you to do that and it also can let you save all the children's work in one go and then reload it the following lesson as well so it removes some of those barriers that you might see with younger children in terms of getting them to work on a programming project over a number of weeks okay so um we are going to have a go so i would like you please to open up a another tab browser okay you can uh you might have to flip between some tabs and i'd like to go to microbit.org join i'll put that in the chat um as well and what you're going to do is you are going to fill in oh thank you very much mark um what you're going to do i'm going to put something else on your screen i'm going to share over what you're going to do is you're going to fill in this information for me okay and this will allow you to join in my live classroom okay so i'm just going to let you have a go sarah's joined instantly i guess i'm gonna have one a few minutes to do we've only got we've got this there is a limit to the number of people you can do this within any one time but the number of people i've got in the chat will uh in the session will mean it's fine there's a limit of 30 children you can't have more than 30 in there um yeah it's true it is stuck in english isn't it that is an interesting point richard hopefully with time and feedback i suppose all i can suggest to you is go hit that feedback button and go and say how do we get this in different languages so one person who's joined is anyone else going to join a couple of i'll give you a minute a couple of minutes to see if you can do that um and then what i'm going to do i'm going to show you how this works live so the more people i've got logged in you'll actually see how it works with students i'm just going to give it another thing lisa hello lisa um it is sometimes the way you sign into it you might go oh it's a bit complicated but the nice thing about this is the fact you don't need usernames and passwords none of that is needed at all the children just have to be able to click on those four icons and then put in the pin code um and if again if you restart your project which again i'll talk about later on if you re start your work in another week uh they will still have to put in these pin codes and icons but it will let you start up your work quite quickly i'm going to give it 30 more seconds uh what i am going to do i'm going to paste this in the chat so people can join in if they decide to oh martha's already done it which is excellent and then the pin code is she gonna beat me there's the pin code as well ah martha wonderful thank you very much so we're five people in which is great okay so this is me in the teacher view you as a student are looking at something that looks like this so you're looking at this which is of course is the mate code uh make code editor that we're all familiar with now what i could do within a lesson of course i could say to you right today we're going to do we're just going to scroll some text we're going to create an animation we're going to create a light sensor for example um we're going to do a teleporting dot for example any of those activities you can come up with and what's nice is you can pull code from the mate code website into classroom quite quickly but i'm going to do something a little bit different because one of the things that is quite powerful with this tool is sharing code with students so what i could do is i could put some code on there for a parsons problem okay so for those of you aren't aware of what a person's problem is it's uh basically when you get a whole bunch of code you're given all the blocks and it's all like a puzzle for the children to put together so if i wanted for example let's create an animation okay so i'm going to drag the blocks you're going to need to create a simpler animation okay so i'm going to drag these blocks on i'm going to give you two pause blocks and i'm actually going to put an input block so i'm going to create an animation that will work when you push the a button for example and what i can do is i can hit the share code student and then it will send this code what's on my screen to the students in the room i will say one health warning with this it will wipe anything you've done so all the people who've already logged into it um all these people if you've got something on your screen it will delete your work so i would only ever do this at the beginning of a lesson never halfway through because it would ruin what they do but it's a good way of starting off so i'm going to send this code to everyone click done you have got a button that pops up that will tell you to um do something with your code so hopefully everyone will see some coding from them so why don't you quickly try and do what i just asked can you make a very quick animation um a two two slide animation that works when you push the a button we don't need to worry about downloading or anything but just can we get something up on the screen i'm gonna give you about a minute or so to do that yep that is good sarah i like that so i'm looking at the chat while people have it working what i'm going to do i'm going to click on student code which of course this is the important bit and this is where i can actually see what people are doing live i say live um what it's doing is showing you the blocks that are snapped together any blocks that are off by themselves you can't see it's only blocks that's all actively running um so they all have to be colored in but i can look through the work and i can see what sarah has done so she's got a very simple animation i can look at richard's work so i'm just picking people at random now and you should see hopefully in a second it will load and what i can do of course is share this code with other people but again if you share the code with individuals or everyone it wipes the code that's in front of them so again be careful ah good yeah so has done it yeah oh good it did do that sometimes things update and you don't see it live um but yeah i can share code you can share code with individual students as well so again it could be just our two children are a little bit behind i'm just going to share a bit of code to get them up and running let's quickly look at i mean now if you accidentally fall offline which is what nadia may have done i don't know if you're still in the chat you can rejoin quite easily and i'll quickly show you what that looks like in a second or you can try that if you want to an idea all you've got to do is you have to go back to the join go back to the same um put in the same dashboard information and then there'll be a drop down list and you can choose should be able to choose your name off of the list and you can come back in to it um that's the only way of doing it but because this session had you in it you should be able to rejoin in theory it depends if it was a an accident or something you should be able to rejoin i've got this on the slides it looks something like um this so if you rejoin a classroom this will come up so you can type you can you can enter in your name we can start look at the little drop down or you can start typing the name in and it will come up as well um so this uh presentation i will share with you and it's got just little hints of how to do all these things so let me just quickly go back to the main screen scroll back up i can collapse all that down if i don't need to see it anymore because again i just want to see who's actually involved and uh oh there we go you're back in yay great see it worked cool excellent right yeah the name doesn't yeah it's to type your name and then it works so sometimes that is a bit of a problem with children who have that issue um so i say children students um so let me just quickly go back so we'll go back to a student code and then we've got so we should now see here we go people are starting to play around with it which is absolutely fine now you do see the code that is uh sort of orphaned off i suppose um so we've got this again this is not about how to use make code is it more about using this tool within the classroom environment let me just have a look some everyone's got something going and so what you can do with this now of course is i can display this on my screen if i want to and talk through with children or why have you done that so it gives a real nice way of one sharing code with everyone but also allowing you to dive a bit deeper and ask questions questions to children about the code that your learners about what they're doing and why and that's something i think we i know in england we talk quite a lot about in terms of pushing a bit deeper and trying to get children to explain clearly what they're doing because they need to have a good understanding of what all these blocks do and it's not it's not in some respects it's fine if it just works but of course if they can't explain coherently what it is they're doing you often sometimes have to question about their actual understanding now something's really useful so if this was something we're working on over a couple of weeks we've worked you've worked on it for a few lessons you can then download all the work so again if you needed this for evidence you wanted the children's evidence or you wanted it to assess you can click this button and what will happen is it will generate a word document which i will show you what it looks like live it takes minutes and every for every learner in the class it will give you a single a4 page with all their code which is again really really nice again you can use that for evidence if you need it but again it could just be useful for um assessment so i'll just show you what it looks like this is just opening on a different screen so once it's loaded i'll move it across so here we go so this is what it looks like this is work in progress that's important number of students all the work so i can click it and then just straight me too straight to the page and then i've got this is me that's my teacher view and then we've got each one's work all the way through so again really useful for teachers in terms of assessment because sometimes you you know you looking out on the computer maybe or especially within the tool itself it can be a bit challenging now if you want to work week to week and actually want to and actually want to be able to continue it this is where the saved classroom box comes in now as you're working something you will have noticed let me go back a step um there is a button somewhere up here where you can finish your work um it doesn't appear on my screen because of course i'm not as a student um this is where you would pair your device or connect your device so if you were going to download it to the mic but you'd do it exactly the same way you would in the normal make code i do notice though that it says pair device still and on make code it says connect device so that's something probably i need to report to make code about that because that needs to change because of course it's similar for both uh but yeah that you click that it's going to pay your pair the device in the same way you can download the microphone and that's something i'd always encourage to make sure the children are getting it actually on their actual micro bits not just doing it on the simulator but they're about to save classrooms so you've got a couple of choices here um nick i just wanted to jump in for a minute because there's a couple of questions that okay relevant right now so um one is a comment from richard just talking about like uh when you say that you can watch the student uh as they're doing their work how do you build that trust between the students so they don't feel like you're watching their camera um in terms of using the the classroom element and then the second piece is can this link out to google classroom there um so the google assistant yes hundred percent you use it in classroom simply you would go to um you share the link the microsoft makecode.org this you'd share all this information on classroom basically i've done it so you'd share that link on classroom you copy and paste all that in post it into the stream or into the assignment the only thing is you have to have it live to work so in order for children to connect to the session just like you guys did it has to be a live session so you can't create this you can't get this information until you've actually gone in to make a session and i'll show you how to do that in a minute when we get towards the end because we've talked about it quite a lot as is it a student i have what it looks like while we're doing it and then i'll show you how to make it but you have to make it for them to join it because this is all uh generated that point but you can do it um depending on how things so it's a good question now richard in terms of um yeah well you can see you can see their code that's all you can see them that's it so you can see your code if you look at what's happening the only thing we can see is their code um in terms of seeing what they're doing no i suppose it's a misspoke in the way i've explained it but you can't see their code live they're not sharing their screen they are all like all you can see is you see their code to be honest it was never an issue when we did the remote learning with the pupils i've been working with uh often they would want to share my screen with me to show me what they were doing actually we did it the other way so again i suppose it depends on your students and making sure that trust element is there hopefully that answers your question richard um cool so once you've finished your work some of you might have even decided i finished there you go this is finished you can restart even though if you finish and you've you give me a little bit of an assessment which is quite nice if i now download your work again it will show me how you've assessed yourself um but we what we're going to save the classroom so i can download the classroom file to my local computer i can end the session then once it's done so i'm just going to show you just going to click it it just downloads a html file um which i i've not delved into but there's just a load of data and it's basically all the blocks you've got i can then end the session i won't end the session now because some of you might still be playing but basically you can end the session and then of course you can resume a session by double clicking the file you've got and it will start session up again so that's quite nice it's really simple to restart it you basically and then you have to re-share how to join and then of course if i go back to my presentation over here it'll ask you to join the classroom again it's important that they remember their name otherwise they won't be rejoining in the same way so by rejoining at the end of the classroom so this is what it looks like for how you feel uh so how do we set up a classroom so let me just do that let's do that live shall we so if i go to classroom it might convince in fact let's see i'm just going to show you actually from if i go to my.org because we always remember them one website don't we you can have more than one session running as well that's worth pointing out if we go over to this is where i'm going to figure out today let's go to uh let's code i think it is good and you've got three options okay so it's built into the website you've got your make code editor python editor and then of course your microwave class just click on this you can go straight there to go classroom.microbit.org now this is just telling me oh you've already got something running because i've already got something running so it's trying to help me there a little bit i called mine session one um i'm gonna say uh delete the recovered data hopefully that won't kill what we're doing maybe it will let's see what happens and then this is what you do to create your create it as simple as give it an activity name it the name really doesn't matter what it is um choose your programming language i'm a primary school teacher um the children only up to the age of 11 so k something or other for those up to k i don't know seven or eight i don't know what it is actually um but yeah so we're i'm working younger children so make code is the highest we need to worry about at that level and then um you basically launch the classroom um i always have this turned on and then you just click launch classroom and then it brings you straight to the page this instructions page show tells you what to do and the bit again you need to share is the dashboard and joining details and you can see it's different already straight away and this is the data this is the information you have to paste into google classroom or um microsoft teams depending whatever platform you're using this is what you need to paste in but you can you only get this information at this point so you have to have it you have to have it running now you can leave it running for as long as you want i've used to do it when i was running it with students i'd have it set up an hour before and it'd just be sitting as a tab open and i've shared the information so therefore when this lesson starts the children can start logging in straight away but that's that's just something i started to do um but yeah it can be as simple as that so let me just close that let's leave this so this is my original one still because it should be still running in theory uh it may not be but let me just go back to my dashboard and see uh yep all of these people are finished and go back to the student code and have a look again it wasn't about the activity today it was more about you just having an explore of what the classroom tool actually does and yeah it comes back here so again if you wanted to download it again resuming classroom is just double clicking the file i won't do that live just because some people might still be logged in but it is just as simple as the resharing information and going from there i'm just going to go back to my presentation just go through if there's any bits i've missed as a student i love how when you submit your finish you get a little sally moment of recognition yeah it does isn't it yeah yeah which is quite nice um so uh let me just go back to here so this is my classroom so all of this i will share with you momentarily dashboard talks about that student code how to save your classroom uh this way it looks like when you resume when you double click it this pops up and you just click resume classroom and that is it that is microbit classroom in a nutshell i will say so are there any other questions um i'm happy to talk for longer but equally if i've said everything i need to say it means you can have five minutes extra break between now and the next session uh let me just copy this link so people can take copies of my slides the slides are written uh just for uh for you to share with other teachers um they're basically there as a sort of reminder of how to do it it's not i'll post it into the chat and you may take copies of that if you would like or pause for any questions thanks nick thanks for posting the um the link there i'm sure everybody's grabbing it right now as next year if you have any questions go ahead and type them in the chat it's absolutely fine i'm happy to uh i i i it's better to finish early and have to do it all together uh how do you change the language in the class emitter that is a brilliant question i don't know if it's possible to be honest let's have a look um because normally it appears under here doesn't it so no it doesn't look like it's possible it's just connected there so as i said i think that's definitely something to take to them and say to um mike a bit oh why isn't why can't we change the the language to other other languages because we i'd like it to be in my language i'm guessing richard you work from a different thing um ah oh good thank you oh you should have laid with the answer richard don't ask me the question leave me the answer [Laughter] well now he's got everybody engaged you know yeah yeah yeah it was good that was good yeah but i floundered for a little while um so so if you go to something you just said if you go to makecode.magabi.org no i've no i i would i'd love to know um anyway so you go to the language which is somewhere shows are often because the language in scratch is like really signposted but the language here i know is where i thought it was um click language so choose it to hmm this is gonna be difficult what our language let's try french because there's some vaguely understand french and then if you go into the make code so then if i go to classroom oh how you doing i don't know if you refresh the page fixes it ah okay that's interesting so maybe that is a quick way to do it richard um once you've made the change in your browser i just refreshed the microphone classroom and it goes straight into it straight into french because it's clearly a browser that's happening on the in the um the local the local files it's not so maybe that's maybe that's quicker i don't know it depends if you start in english or you want to start in french um or whatever language you're going to but yeah all i did there was just refresh the page and it's gone straight into french so maybe that's the way there's there's a live solution to it to make it a bit quicker but yeah yeah it seemed like that's the only way to do it at the moment but i would definitely go uh put that as a feature request and go can we have it because there's no good reason why you can't have the gear i can't see any good reason why you can't have it um and on in but interestingly of course that menu is still out of date it's still in english even though and paired devices should say connect device so maybe there's just something in the background it's i suppose it's worth pointing out the microcosm is still in beta um it's it's never coming out of bayer it doesn't fade very clearly at the top um hopefully at some point it will come out because it's been around for quite a while uh but again i suppose this is why uh this session even exists because not enough people probably know about michael clarkson and are actually using it so it's a tool that i use all the time when i'm using um even in class i do use it because it's just a good way of being able to see the kids work gather it all together and also push code out to children in a way that it's more challenging to do with micro bit compare using make code versus using um scratch for example i know a lot last year when everybody was online um it was a great tool for remote learning options too so yeah that's and that's how i discovered it and how i started using it because and it was proper beta then it was absolutely things changed while i was while i was using it we were all better than nick yeah we were all beaten then learning how to teach that yeah it's true right um any other questions hopefully richard uh i've not helped you but i maybe found a slightly quicker way by doing it once and hitting refresh and then it's done but yeah other than that i think my time is nearly up i think is that right uh we still have a few more minutes but that oh okay um what i was going to say is help microbit.org is a great um email for you to ask these questions if we weren't in a live scenario and and for being able to think through this together um help microbit.org go straight to the tech team and so they love these type of questions and the reflections that nick have given even in terms of the menu in the format so please be as generous with your thoughts and ideas as you were here with the foundation so that they can track this and address the questions and the improvements that you uh would suggest i'll quickly add one thing then while we have a few more minutes um this is i mentioned this in passing and but if you go to any project within the make code website elsewhere you can click and open the code directly in classroom so if you know this is the project we're doing and it's going to start with by clicking the opening classroom button it will actually start the classroom up pull the data in and then allow children to start and then you can get children's connected which i quite like again if you're using some of the great resources plug plug within the micro on the micro bit website itself as well cool so any other questions i think we're good so our next session starts at um one let me just 125 so between 125 my time which is 6 25 your time nick yes you did i was thinking 125. it's not 125 here 20 past six and yeah it's about six so um just as a reminder there's the session chat and then there's the event chat so please take time to review both chat streams so you can um network this with as many people as possible try the networking feature out click on networking and see who you get um paired with have a three-minute conversation say hey and what you're working on it's a neat little experience check out the expo get yourself a drink of water and a stretch and a huge thank you to nick for sharing his experiences and microbit classroom because like he said it's a a bit of a a secret possibly so get in there and start using it to help scaffold for your students the coding experience and now you can do it in multiple languages thanks to richard's little hack there so thanks nick um we'll see you online at hashtag microbit live and check out the sessions the networking and have a fantastic rest of your session thanks for being here thank you thanks for playing as well those people who joined in live great work
