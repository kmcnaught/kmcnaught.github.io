um so thank you very much for the intro my name is rihanna and i'm a creative educational technologist which means that i try to bring coding creativity together to design really hands-on and creative learning experiences now i have a very special bond with the microbit because the first time i coded was with a microbit about four years ago now um and the first thing i did was code the ladies on the screen to work um and i was hooked from that moment um it was it was really cool to see that you can code something on a computer and make it come to real life um in the real world sorry excuse me um so um from then on so fast forward to now um i designed lots of lessons around the microbit um in the realm of creative technology musical technology and physical computing and now my most um my one of the one of my most favorite one of my most um yeah one of my most favorite actually components of the micro bit is the accelerometer which is an onboard component that measures where it is in space across three axes um and that allowed me to to make really cool projects like musical um a musical glove and all other kinds of cool stuff um but one time i was playing one of my favorite games which you might know of it's the dinosaur game that can play if you have no wi-fi or internet um on any google chrome browser um and when i was playing it a bell rang inside my head and i thought hey why can't i why don't i play this game with the micro bit so why don't i use the accelerometer on the micro bit to play the game and control the dinosaurs jumping with my palm um so i was really really invested in this idea but i had no idea where to start um and this idea this this feeling of not knowing where to start or not knowing where to begin can be quite overwhelming and it can cause many projects to never come into realization um so i turned to my twitter friends and i posted a tweet asking for any help if anyone has any resources or any ideas on how i can play the google chrome game with the microbit now i was really overwhelmed with with the response that i got um everyone was sharing their resources with me and i was at that moment i was really humbled and very grateful because um it's very very unique to be part of a community that is so collaborative so selfless and just so caring um so that made me very grateful for the lovely community that we have and that we build together um now from all of the responses that i got there were two very useful ones um one of them is from david will who you might know as the wizard as the microbiota wizard which he truly is because he always has a solution for any microbit problem um and the second resource is by musab killich who actually created a whole guide on um on something called a micro bike which does the exact same thing that i wanted to do with the dinosaur game so these two made my life much much much easier um and i combined these two and musab actually wrote a really good guide um on it i can send the link in the chat as well um so yeah so now we go we are we're we're here for the demo now um so let me stop this um and go to all of you this is the t-rex game i'm playing an online version because obviously if i wanted to play a um offline version you would all lose me this is my microbit it's running it says so let's try it i'm going to try to beat my own high score which a second oops which about an hour ago was like 400 points i promise so we'll see by the way that i'm holding the micro bit up there we go okay yeah we can uh we can stop this now where are where's everyone over here um so let me just quickly stop this program otherwise it will mess up with my with my keyboard um i resumed from my to my slides um so yeah that's it i hope i was inside the five minutes um again um i wanted to thank everyone for being such wonderful people in this really great community um i'm always i'm also planning on contributing and making a video on this on this project using david and the saab's resources um so that everyone can turn um can make can play the dyno game with their micro bits and we can have worldwide microbit dinosaur competitions all around the world so i'm on twitter and i'm also on linkedin i don't know it's here at remote but uh would be great to connect and thank you very much
