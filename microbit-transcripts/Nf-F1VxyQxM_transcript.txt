yeah thanks please uh hi everyone i'm james devine i'm a researcher at microsoft research thanks for the intro blaze and i'm going to talk today uh about the micro bit and accessibility um and the first thing i want to bring up is that accessibility or disability is a very important topic it's also a very sensitive topic so i just want to be clear i'm still learning if if i need some further education or if i if i say something that um is perceived to be incorrect please do reach out to me on either twitter or through email and i'll happily uh address what whatever the issue was so a rough outline of the talk actually is very precise outline the first thing we're going to talk about is disability broadly we're then going to move on to talking about assistive technologies and that we can use to counter disability to an extent then we're going to cover um using uh well building assistive technology with only a micro bit then we're going to talk a little bit about a new hardware prototyping platform we've been working on for the past two years called jet deck and how we can use jackdack and the microbit to empower more people to build assistive technology and so to start off with what is disability i always find this to be a mind-blowing statistic right i mean over 1 billion people around the world live with some form of disability and we all have our own sort of connection to disability maybe you have a family member who has a disability maybe you teach a student with a disability or maybe you even have a disability yourself and there are of course many different types of disabilities some of them are invisible and some of which are quite apparent and we're going to be particularly covering uh physical disability now i was uh i i was reading the uh a few months ago about the different categories of disability i didn't really realize that there could be such a thing but as i say i'm always learning and there's kind of three categories of disability the first is permanent disability so for example a person who is completely paralyzed has a permanent mobility impairment then you might think temporary so if you've got permanent what does a temporary disability look like and so perhaps if you've broken your arm you have a temporary mobility impairment and then there's a third type which is situational and so you might think what the situation will mean in this context how can you be situationally disabled um and one example of this is perhaps a carrying a large box and therefore you have a situational mobility impairment regardless of your current interaction with disability it's likely at some point that someone close to you or even yourself will develop a disability so it's important we think about accessible technologies and the other thing i'd like to sort of call out that maybe if you're an educator you might consider introducing accessibility and accessibility style lessons like design design lessons around accessibility uh to your students because a lot of the reasons why the technology we use today isn't very accessible is because it wasn't designed with accessibility in mind and here's a great example of designing for accessibility being beneficial to everyone um this is just a random youtube video of what i lied to and you see that there's closed captions and closed captions were originally created for people who are deaf or hard of hearing um but actually it's really beneficial to everyone else who who watches and consumes media content uh perhaps your fiance's just come in after a long day and you've been you know you want to watch your video but you don't want to annoy her that's a very real scenario sometimes for me um and so i i love closed captions too okay so that was a little bit about disability i'm now going to move on to assistive technology wow look at those look at those powerpoint transitions wow um okay uh so we can use uh assistive technologies to uh counter disability so why do we need to counter disability well as i mentioned most of the devices we use aren't necessarily considerably designed to be accessible first this is changing you can see the profile of accessibility as has risen over the past decade or so and as i mentioned specifically in this talk we're going to be considering physical disability and so here's a little thought experiment for you um have you ever thought about trying to use a desktop pc or a laptop without a keyboard or a mouse uh just have a think about that for a second i'm sure a few of you are mousing around in other web browser windows or interacting maybe you're doing work maybe you're typing right now well that would be super difficult without a keyboard or a mouse can you imagine not doing it with those two things um fortunately there are some pc accessibility options that we we do have available and there's there's a huge amount of them but i've just kind of picked some some highlights here so uh perhaps you can move a mouse uh but you lack the fine grain motor control to actually you know perform left click and right click and so you might think to yourself so you can move your mouse okay i'll use my feet maybe i've got full control over my my legs and so you might actually purchase the x-keys foot controller which is on the left-hand side of the screen and therefore you can then click with your left foot and right foot to perform left and right click uh perhaps you can only move your fingers um in which case so you can't you can't you know pick up your mouse and move it from side to side you can only perform my new actions with your fingers in which case the trackball mouse might be the best option for you instead of having to move the mouse around you actually use the big yellow ball in the center of the mouse to move the cursor around your screen if you're blind or visually impaired you might consider using an orbit brailler because you obviously cannot make out the keys on a on a keyboard um and so um the the braillers are kind of an interesting device because you've got both input and output on the on the device itself so at the bottom of the of the device you've got braille cells that if you highlight text on something like word or a text editor you'll be able to see those ascii characters in braille at the bottom of the display and those big white buttons sort of positioned like this if you were to look at my hands um those are for actually inputting braille characters and having them appear as ascii and if you can't move at all perhaps the eye gaze tracker is for you and so you can navigate your personal computer using just your eyes but if you don't fit into these any of these existing device device categories you need something a bit more specialized to you and for that you kind of look at this ecosystem of access switches now access switches are incredibly simple it's a switch that i can click you might be able to hear it on one side and on the other side you've got a 3.5 millimeter jack and these access switches plug into access switch input boxes so i can just plug it in there like that and if i had my excuse box hooked up to my pc i'll be able to control uh my pc using just a switch and you get various types of these different switches and you can see uh sorry access switch input boxes you can see one of them at the bottom left hand corner of the screen which is the h2 um you can see some of the functionality it has by default um one of the modes is you know acting as a mouse so you can map five different switches to uh five different mouse interactions and then you've also got other modes which you can explore and you also get a whole host of different switches for example you can get a big round plastic one or you can get a super soft pillow based switch if you if you don't have that fine-grained motor control and the other thing is that switch access is widely adopted you've got devices like the xbox adaptive controller that you can use with your xbox and you've got these assistive toys that allow someone to experience the pleasure of triggering um like either a voice action or having the elephant move using access switches and in terms of interacting with personal computing devices here's a couple of examples so i'm just going to go through the ios example here so you when you're in assistive switch mode you get this blue column that's that scans across the screen and you push the switch and it stops at a particular point and then you get a vertical bar that goes up the screen and through doing that you can you can pinpoint you see here you can pinpoint a particular application okay so how do we build assistive technology with the micro bit and so to do that i'm going to introduce uh matt openheim he's a visiting researcher at lancaster university and he's also an offshore engineer and for periods of time like six months or so he he goes and maintains expensive machinery his background is in electronics and he's also pretty good at drawing cartoons that's that's his cartoon of himself and his contact information is there and all content is provided by matt so thanks a lot to matt for this uh upcoming section so when matt is in uh offshore around the world somewhere um and he's in lancaster he actually um consults at beaumont college you know free of charge um and burma college is a local uh school um in lancaster that specializes in people with severe disabilities and they provide these people with new and interesting experiences and they also have on-site occupational therapists to help experiment with new assistive technologies and so occupational therapists they typically um are really good at mechanical modifications and this isn't an example provided by beaumont this is just an example from the microsoft resource and you can see actually two joysticks here have been specially adapted for the person in the wheelchair the left hand joystick has actually got a soft felt on top of it and you can actually see that the person's wearing on their wrist a a velcro pad and so that allows them to use the underside of the wrist to actually control that joystick and on the left hand side um is another joystick that locks into that person's palm and so occupational therapists are really good at these kind of mechanical adaptations uh but what if you can't use any of this existing uh switch technology what do you do then like what if you don't fit into inside these boxes with the with access switch technology well burma actually came to matt and um with with some examples of this for example one student uh could only move a finger and so they didn't actually have the strength to operate a switch and another student could only move uh their wrist laterally um and not very reliably um so obviously they don't really fit into this ecosystem of access switches so you need someone to come along and build some new assistive technology and so that's what matt did so matt came up with one particular answer around flex sensors and flex sensors are a super interesting type of sensor they allow us to detect uh the amount of deflection or bending of the sensor itself and this is especially useful if you have limited movement for example here's some pictures courtesy of map of different ways you could you could think about using flex sensors and so if you had a flex sensor on your thumb you could measure the amount of of bent just from having it attached to your thumb and you can think about other ways in which this could be used and here's where the micro microbit came in so matt then built a system using two micro bits uh one micro bit was connected to a flex sensor um and when that threshold of the flight sensor hit a specific threshold it sent a message wirelessly to another micro bit that was plugged into one of those access switch input boxes and so very quickly you can build up a new type of switch for this access switch input technology uh underneath the lovely yellow cases are um a couple of modifications to um edge connectors um so for the flex sensor the transmitter side of things you've got an edge connector with some electrical connections to the flex sensor and on the receiver side you've got another edge connector that's been modified to electrically connect to an audio jack just like with a normal access switch of course he 3d printed a case and i understand this was quite an involved and iterative process and this was to ensure that the the devices didn't cause any irritation and were safe to use basically but in short we need more people like matt there are you know there are an insurmountable amount of people around the world that need this kind of custom technology and there's few maps in the world to help build these kind of technologies so we're not it's not like overnight we're going to transform every uh every every person into an electronics engineer capable of doing these kinds of things so we need to lower the barrier entry for people to build assistive technology okay just gonna take a sip of water okay so that was um building assistive technology with the microwave uh next i'm to talk about jack dac so um everyone's probably on school probably quite familiar with programming and microbit so i don't need to go on about it but it is super easy we've got a wealth of different programming editors from scratch to microblocks to micropython to make code and they all make programming a microcontroller in this case the bike a bit easier than ever before the other thing that's super easy is connecting a single accessory to the microbit you can see all of these fantastic accessories available on microwave.org and that you can buy for your microwave to make computer science education that more engaging but if you ever want to do anything more than that it it becomes a bit more complex like sometimes you might have to get out a breadboard and make individual electrical connections and this is hard to do let alone in a classroom environment and you might say to yourself well james there's all of these modular solutions that exist today well they might solve the electrical interconnectivity problem but in terms of software there's still quite a lot of barriers there you have to work out what particular library you need to use and so you really need to have an understanding of kind of the lower level protocols and how they all work so what we've been working on for the past couple of years uh is this new prototyping technology called dag and it's a way of bringing a plug-and-play experience down to low-cost electronics um and what we often like to do is liken this to usb but for low-cost microcontrollers um if you think about usb um when you're plugging a mouse into a computer you don't really have to do much else most of the time you plug in your mouse and it and your computer knows it's a mouse it knows how to talk to it and your mouse is ready to use within a few seconds and so we want to create that same experience but for physical computing and for the micro bit um and on the left hand side that kind of captures uh the experience we want to create create we've got a micro bit um uh connected to that micro bit is a jack dac adapter and hanging off that microphone a whole bunch of sensors are connected using a reversible low-cost cable um and so you can plug these devices in any which any which way they all connect together and you'll be able to use them in your make code or other programming environments programs and so now i just very want to quickly um create a flex sensor demo uh using jackdack make code and the microphone okay all right let me just transition okay all right so that was fairly straightforward so i'm just going to focus my camera to my desk hopefully that's coming through okay yeah yes it is okay so uh on my desk you see a micro bit and on the screen share you see uh make code so i'm just gonna make a new project and call it flex sensor i'm just gonna create it great uh so i've got my wifi on my desk it's got nothing plugged into it uh i'm gonna i'm gonna attach a jack dac adapter which looks like this i'm just going to plug that into the bottom so now the one thing i need to do is add the jackpack extension in make code i'm just going to do that and check back okay so now our mate code editor is jackdack enabled so what that means is i can get a device like a slider i can plug it into the bottom of my micro bits and you'll see a simulator has appeared for my slider so if i slide it up and down you can see the value changing in real time but of course i promised a demo using a flex sensor so i'm going to get one of those i'm just going to plug it in if i can do it there we go as you'll see as we bend and flex the sensor its value changes now the other thing we have in jack that is a usb module and i can use this to control my computer using a mouse and a keyboard so i'll plug that into my bus too and you'll see hopefully if i scroll down uh that we've got a keyboard and mouse simulator appear uh so if i go to my modules category which was added when i added the jack deck extension you'll see it's pretty bare at the moment there's nothing there and so what i'm going to do is add the click the add blocks button and it will automatically detect what i've got plugged in and install the the corresponding packages for them and then we'll get the lovely blocks that we're all so familiar with so if i open my modules category now you'll see that i've got blocks for my flex sensor and for keyboard and mouse so i'm just going to grab the flexing block i'm going to use it so what i want to do is if we bend the flex sensor you'll see that its value changes you know to around 40 when i've got it flexed a significant amount maybe you can't quite see that so i'm going to have an if statement that oops i'm now looking at the wrong screen that does a check to see if the value is greater than 40 the value of the flex sensor is greater than 40. 40 and then i want to use it to move my mouse along the screen i had a minus five so when i bent it my mouse cursor should move to the left and the other thing to mention is that um the uh simulator also participates as a jack deck device so i don't actually need to download my code to the browser in order to inject uh mouse event to the micro bit in order to inject mouse events so if i bend this now hopefully you'll see my cursor move you see it moved along the left hand side of the screen and there you go so that was a very quick demo using jack i can of course deploy it um but i think we're probably running out of time so i will go back to my presentation and we'll resume things shortly if you just give me two seconds yeah okay okay we should be back i'm just to take it for granted that we're back okay so if you want to learn more about jack dac then please go to police talk which is happening tomorrow on the 4th of december he'll be going into all of this technology in a lot more depth okay so the final topic is piecing this all together how can we empower people to build assistive technology using jackdack and the microbit and so to do this i want to talk about a project we worked on just over the past few months it was called project make accessible and the idea behind project make accessible was using that these these three technologies make code jackdack and the microbit can we empower more people to build custom accessibility devices and so now it's time for a short video you've heard enough from me so you can hear from someone else for three minutes okay so um blaze would be great if you could let me know the sound's coming through okay thanks yeah everything is part of binge sounds good we'll face a permanent temporary or situational disability in our lives that will impact how we use technology off-the-shelf accessibility solutions often require further customization which is slow complex and limits available solutions it is very variable what their abilities are you just find like the more ways and quicker ways to build and adjust assisted setups so that everyone can contribute in this hackathon we tested a device creation platform called jackpack and learned how it could empower more people to build flexible custom assistive technologies jackpack makes it easy to build custom devices from low cost hardware and low code software using reversible cables hardware modules are instantly recognized as you connect them and can be programmed to work together through simple drag-and-drop programming devices can also be easily reconfigured through jacktap without any programming at all we distribute ejecta hardware kits to microsoft hackers and ngos to answer the question could more people create assisted technologies using jack dac the answer yes yes they can [Music] [Music] it would be super useful to have an easy like let's reconfigure this keyboard without researching which software you're going to download and fill up the usb i have a daughter who have a genetic disorder she has a problem with her speech communication with her is definitely a challenging one especially for her to communicate her pain and problems to us with the jackpack based on the puzzles that she clicks it will create an alarm for us what if you can't interact with devices with your voice audio assistive tech can be expensive or hard to use with jacktack we built a button to speech interface that gives a voice to those who can't use their own what if you don't have fine-tuned motor control and want to use teams we created an accessible teams interface device making it easier to raise your hands toggle mute upload and so on creating a solution using eject deck it's amazing it's amazing distance from idea to implementation is really really short just connect your sensor and it just works it will be suitable for people with different disabilities disabilities and spectrum and jack dac allows you to sort of have an affordable spectrum of tools they can kind of modulate grow or customize we envision a future where everyone can interact with any device microsoft products should support an open standard like jack dac while working with other tech companies to create a new accessible hardware ecosystem this is a critical step towards empowering every person on the planet to achieve their full potential okay so that was a little bit about make accessible so as mentioned in the video it was an internal company hackathon and we engaged with uh three external ngos who gave us feedback and tested out and built various assistive technologies using using the kit we set we had over 80 hackers from around the world and for those who wanted a hardware kit we also distributed those kits around the world and what was in a hardware kit well in each kit there was a micro bit a jack dac adapter some cables for connecting modules together and we also asked hackers to fill out a form and tell us what they their intended application was that they wanted to build with jackdack and we actually tailored each kit that we sent to each person with a suite of modules that they'd kind of we kind of aligned to their application the most important thing that we distributed alongside hardware kits were jack-jack snacks or jack snacks for sure and these are basically just m eminem's embossed with a jacked up logo but they were very well received all in all so what did people build you saw various snapshots of what people built in the in the video and you can see some of those uh plain miniature on the screen in front of you we had people experimenting with accessible interfaces for microsoft teams we had students are building deaf and hard of hearing floor finders like for example if um if your elevator doesn't announce what floor you're on well how does a deaf person or hard of hearing person work out what floor they're on so they actually use the micro bit with proximity to kind of work out uh which floor there are we also had people looking at integrating uh make accessible jackdack and the microbit into minecraft education edition which i which was super interesting old braille was also super cool and here someone was looking at ways of making the micro bit a bit more accessible using braille displays but i do want to call out one particular work stream which was this button to speech workstream uh so this is yara uh she's six years old and like any six-year-old she absolutely loves baby shark um and if you're not familiar with baby shark i'm just going to do a quick rendition unfortunately it's not drumming it's singing which is substantial i'm substantially less good at singing so here you go baby shark doo doo doo doo doo baby shark doo doo okay and it goes on and on like that for like a long time and you go go all the way to daddy shark and then back to the beginning again in any case she absolutely loves the song however yara suffers from cerebral palsy and this impacts her in various different ways she uh has various spasms and she also has difficulties communicating using speech she also has a sister and her sister doesn't uh suffer from cerebral palsy and so it's really frustrating to yara to see her sister do things that she cannot and one of those things is interacting with smart assistants and so this is a video of yara trying to use alexa [Music] [Music] so you can see that alexa or others other smartphone assistants sorry if i've just triggered your alexis i just triggered mine um she has difficulties understanding what you are saying um but this isn't just specific to smart assistants people yara interacts with might have difficulty understanding what she says and of course you can get a speech assistive technology and that you know utters specific phrases and allows you to push buttons and and build up phrases however it's not exactly designed for yara's needs yara as i mentioned suffers from spasms so she doesn't have the ability to pinpoint various points on a surface like you would have to do if you're pushing buttons so using make accessible can we build something a bit more customized and this is what we built for yara so you can think of this effectively like a handheld stool that you can place on top of various smart assistants or you can carry around with you inside the plastic top is an integrated speaker a text-to-speech jackdack module and a micro bit and that micro bit has been loaded with various different phrases and you can actually yara can actually swap different phrases on and off the micro bit using using jack dac and a web page to navigate through the phrase bank there's a rotary control which you can see integrated into the top here and once you've selected a phrase you can hit this button and that phrase is spoken out into the world and so here's a video of yara using her device okay i believe that's all i've got time for um i'm happy to take questions um but you can see how happy yara was uh just with such a simple device that was put together in a day um and this is really what we're trying to enable we're trying to enable more people to build assistive technology so thank you for listening uh please do reach out if you have any questions comments um i'm always available thank you very much thanks so much james really appreciate it um before we close out the session we definitely do have some questions that i just want to make sure we get through before we're out of time um so we had a question earlier and i may have answered it but definitely want to double check based on your feedback so someone was asking if there's an advantage to using wireless transfer between the sensor and computer instead of direct wire connection um i was thinking it was maybe cable management but i'm not sure if you have any more feedback on that that's precisely what it is and also the other thing um would be the flexibility mounting option so you can see that matt presumably we're talking about the flex sensor with the two micro bits but you know if you've got a big bulky power supply that's you know mounted on your wrist you're less inclined to use it it's going to be less comfortable than and and also you know if you've got a cable running all the way to to the device um it's likely that that will impact the the movement of your arm which are you know it's already impacted as it is with disability okay that that's perfect great um we so um i believe someone hopped in with their own recommendation but definitely would love to see if you have any suggestions um someone was wondering if there's um a more accessible solution that you know of for breadboard prototyping um uh so hopefully someone uh being steve or paul might have jumped in with that uh but there's um kirsten uh customs on the call probably um yeah so uh there are a few uh breadboarding accessible blind accessible breadboarding uh publications that i'm happy to share if you email me um which i've taken i've stopped sharing my screen but you're happy to i'll yeah we'll work it out um and then there's also the blind arduino blog there's a really fantastic blog about using arduino if you're blind and so that has some really fantastic resources and also there's uh the new york public library um have actually actually run specific uh blind arduino sessions um and so that's run by chancey fleet if you reach out to her on twitter again i can also um put you in touch amazing and that's why i double checked with you because you had way more solutions than what was recommended in chat so that's amazing so two more real quick ones and i i think they may have been answered already but i believe it was pele um hopefully i'm probably in the chat um but we just had a couple of quick inquiries asking how they can get jack back um and how they can be a part of the next round of hacking so i believe kelly mentioned that that will be addressed uh in tomorrow's session exactly spot on uh i will say no more uh please please the person please attend this talk and i'm sure you'll be surprised i don't know no that's that's perfect if it's addressed tomorrow then we can leave it till then i believe it's addressed tomorrow so please do attend perfect okay um well with that being said i'm sorry because i know everyone we're going just slightly over time but please everyone please hop in chat send our pray center thanks um james james the divine thank you so very much for your incredible inclusive and accessible session it was it was really amazing like i i remember just super quick um seeing the xbox adaptive controller when it first came out and the only switches available for it were through ablenet and they were so expensive for a single button and all i could think of was we we need more accessible and cheaper solutions so it's you know things like jack jack and and that that are contributing to that cause and it's just amazing to see it in the works um so thank you so much for for your session and for all the information um with that everyone please you know feel free uh to to leave the session whenever you're ready that's that's it for today we do still have our closing remarks but i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day and we'll be right back at it again tomorrow so james thank you again and have a great day everyone thanks everyone thanks blaze thanks james bye now
