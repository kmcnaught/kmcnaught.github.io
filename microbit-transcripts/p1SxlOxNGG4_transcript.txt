thanks bailey so let me share my screen here so hi everyone welcome to ai robots so we're here we're going to show you a free open source web tool that we built for integrating vision recognition and other ai capabilities into micro bank so brenda and reid are going to show you some projects we're writing a book that's going to be published in the summer by make called ai robots so it all starts here at the google teachable machine website we're not going to go through the entire specifics of the website but it's a massive time saver and quickly to make quickly and easy to use tensorflow files for implementing ai to your web projects the specific project is using the pose recognition software to look at the body positions of movements all of our classes are set up with pac data sets that we're going to use to activate our servos click train and refer to process then can play around and test our ai to make sure it's accurate enough for our project when we're happy we simply save the model to the cloud and copy the link it gives us this link will be really important in the future when we're done we can head over to the micro bit make code website and use some blockchain code to give some meaning to these classes thanks brenda since this code uses this uses a web usb connection to talk to the ai website we made we need to set up a few lines of code in order to open up that connection and store whatever information is sent over this line as you can see on the screen here we actually keep this as a downloadable file handy as a handy reference on our website but after that it's just a matter of setting up some if statements that are activated by the classes you made in the google site uh see here in the video we're just adding in some commands to activate some servos that are gonna activate the shield project and the beauty of this is that it's so simple that you can add new classes to essentially create thousands of new unique inputs that bring your microbits projects to life really just limited by pins and your imagination and how much you want to train your ai definitely but getting back to the process when the code is finished we just simply upload it to the microbit and all the hard work is done uh the final step just takes us to the website where you can enjoy the fruits of your labor and marry the teachable machine to our code as you can see in the video we just need to uh to enter in the address we get from step one and after that a few moments you can see your project popped to life and you see that it was um responsive to our movements without actually pressing a button here's an example project that we have made recently you can speak on that um yeah that's just it's just a simple like ski ball type machine that is activated by a coin counter uh you can see the ai here is looking for a quarter and when it sees a corner it activates the rest of the machine um allowing you to to play the game so it actually blocks you out when you're not playing or you can make a really useful application uh check out this project made from eric thornson from strawberries in sweden he's made a robot that can store colored balls and beyond the copious amount of parts from his fantastic learning tool at strawbee's he's using only two server motors to move the balls and push them to the proper paths this tool is really just a great way to add purpose or emotion to your creations as well uh like create a muscle man here or a robot that can tell you what food is good like cheese there or there's even as you'll see in a second here we've created uh strawbeats has created a little robot that can play peek-a-boo with you or keep you entertained for hours just by checking the facial recognition patterns my favorite though is the one you'll see in just a second here um i've created a little living owl type creature um who i've actually named archimedes let's see in just a second there he is uh who's actually able to follow you around the screen based on your simple location just based on a left center and right and then i've also added in a couple more things to make it more lifelike like servos connected by linkages on the back to kind of give it that personal feeling um and then if you're really just looking for a fun exhibit this is something that was created uh by one of our associates june heavy um and he built this amazing self-sufficient roller coaster that you can place that can place the carts back on or the balls back on the cart and here's the example the go to class training an ai to recognize their stuffies and answer questions like which one is its birthday and then activate a thumbs up thumbs down so having this kind of project is connected to what they want to do and things are important to them really make it a great entry point for ai for understanding how ai works so if you think this is interesting check out the tool talk to us we run free play in ours for other educators experiment and also we collaborate on grant proposals and on staff development trainings and of course stay tuned for our book we're going to release it creative commons for educators as well as being published by make thanks everybody
