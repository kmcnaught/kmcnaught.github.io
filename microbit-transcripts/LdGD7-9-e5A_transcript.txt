thanks very much can can everyone see my screen yep looking great perfect well uh yeah so hello to everyone from a very iranian uh cold glasgow morning or noontime now um so today i just wanted to share with you a story of how the microwave kind of saved the day for me when i was trying to introduce um local high school students to what it means to you to basically build chemist robots right um so a little bit about me my background is in computers so i've always been really fascinated with coding i've always loved coding and programming computers and then also i did my phd in chemistry so very unrelated i guess but i've always wanted to combine the two so all these years in the fume hood twirling away and doing repetitive stuff i always wanted to kind of automate it and build a essentially a robot chemist right and so after my phd i started looking and found this group in glasgow that's why i'm here um that basically does exactly this so the chronic group in the university of glasgow a very large group so about 60 people lots of post docs lots of phd students and a lot of a lot of funding and so the qr code there is if you want to check out our website and so i always wanted to basically take this magic of building chemist's robot chemist and introduced it to a younger audience and thankfully in the kind of gloomy and perhaps a little bit sad days of lockdown last year something really amazing happened to me and that was the royal society of chemistry gave me some money to exactly do what i wanted so i started this outreach project with a local high school in glasgow called digital chemistry for digital natives so to to take these this generation of digital natives have always known about the internet and phones and apps and stuff and then uh enabled them to kind of connect that with chemistry so i um i basically the premise is like yeah science can feel a bit dry on its own but you can actually just start building your own stuff that does chemistry for you and you can record your data do all the repetitive stuff and it's a lot of fun so these amazing pictures were drawn by my former lab mate naomi johnson who had the pleasure of collaborating with on this outreach project and so this was in the depth of lockdown so um i guess uh not much could be done in person so i kind of set up a website called 0101 cam.science the qr code is there if you want to jump to it and started creating content on this website and so starting with like scratch sketches that the kids could edit and then um ask naomi to kind of show the algorithmic nature of chemistry so how chemistry is also made of instructions just like in computer programs um or basically showing how chemists can optimize a reaction by choosing like parameters like you season your food like salt and pepper you add more salt more pepper it's too hot too salty and then you find something that's just right but then something amazing happened the vaccines came and then uh kind of we went back to almost normal life so i managed to take one of the robot chemists in our lab and take it all the way to the high school and show the students which i thought was amazing um so so um i managed to we managed to do a little titration experiment even but something that was a little bit too sweet about all this was that the the equipment was extremely expensive so uh and also you need to know like you know the exact sort of api of all the pumps and valves that work in the system to use it so my idea was to make it more accessible to the students so i wanted to come back to the school with a new project where they could do it themselves and they could take it home and luckily i remembered watching this video on youtube of someone making a water pump with a microbit just a straw and a microbead so basically i just went ahead and ordered 10 micro bits so pick 10 students bought 10 micro bits and 10 tiny several motors and thankfully these ones don't need an actual power supply so you can just power it over the usb that you connect to the micro bit and um just some alligator or crocodile clips and and some paper clips to measure a ph do the same titration essentially i couldn't find any plastic straws so i had to use some broken pants it's a plastic frozen been outlawed in the eu now i think uh anyway so the idea was just make a little circuit and measure the the the voltage between these two and so when you have a basic solution it has high conductivity but as you start titrating adding acid to it you get to neutral the conductivity drops and so when you find the lowest conductivity that's when you've kind of finished your titration so that was the main idea and so we only had two hours for this session but we managed to basically get the basics uh construct the kind of chemistry parts so paper clips in a solution of base that you add acid to and then use the microwave to read the connectivity essentially um and it's really cool that you can see the reading live and then attach the servo motor so the kids did it all themselves in groups of two a little bit of guidance and then attach that sort of pen barrel to the micro uh to the to the to the servo to use for liquid transfer between the acid and base vessels and then finally do the titration so um the best part about the whole thing was afterwards i just i just told them you can take everything home so every kid got the whole set the microwave the motor everything to just go crazy and do whatever they want with it afterwards um so yeah that's it uh from me i would like to thank the europe society chemistry for this very generous uh funding that enabled this i want to thank the high school that we collaborated with whitehall secondary and especially the science teacher sapphire malalu that uh basically tirelessly worked with me uh many many messages of coordinating this and that thank you sapphire and also the inspiration we see the digital chemistry group at glasgow so thank you very much i'm looking forward to any questions that you have in the chat
