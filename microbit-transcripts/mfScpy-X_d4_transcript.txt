yeah hello hello everyone i'm jaiwan let me show you my slide okay actually i'm on a business trip here in major province of korea zhangju so i attached this sticker on the workshop so i i love love love it so came here anyway uh let's get started hello this is jay wanzo from future lab as a true fan of microbead and as a microbead champion last year it's my pleasure to be able to share my experience here i'd like to thank the microbit educational foundation for providing me this great opportunity to share my wonderful experiences with more than 2 thousand young people 8 to 18 years of age and also educators in korea first of all let me provide you with a little information about me yeah i am cheo han sol and i define myself as an educator as well as a credit creator i loved hack electronics using micro bit and discover ways to create useful things in my daily life like this more or more than that i enjoy sharing this kind of joy with the young people i meet at future lab every week future lab is a foundation established by smile gate a global entertainment group located in pango south korea as a creative producer at future futurelev i design youth workshops that encompass visual art and sound music woodworking programming engineering and bioscience in collaboration with various groups of a specialist such as doctor scientist artist even yo-yo master do you know yo-yo we will collaborate with yo-yo master really to us workshops are not simply a set of programs we offer but later on opportunity to learn from our experience and build a better creative learning environment for our young people sometimes creativity is understood as a competence of few individuals who have brought great innovation to the world like steve jobs however future lab does not rely on such kind of brilliance but later more pays attention to the concept of originality we believe each of our originality is where our creativity begins this is the reason why future lab focuses on cultivating a culture and environment that encourage and support young people to be aware of their originality understand oneself that includes their needs interests and passions and further nurture their own creativity at future lab young people are encouraged to explore whatever interests them create experiments and enjoy the hard fun while dealing with challenges and eventually find motivation to go further for the last five to six years future lab has been continuing such practice based research on what unleashes young people's creativity and attempt to build on a culture of respect and the learning environment where they feel safe enough enough to take risks and experiment regardless of the idea we hoped shared this vision with more people and lead a movement that would eventually impact a change in our education system as well in fact this grand vision has always been key to every project we have been creating including the do your beat challenge it is always a pleasure to meet and work with young people however the kovid 19 pandemic became a great challenge for future lab and myself as an educator can you feel my software there and here while we are quite confident with meeting young people in person online was a different kind of challenge but we met drill bit in fact do your bid was a timely opportunity to experiment with the possibility of bringing the future lab experience online without compromising the core components of our philosophy under the name of the microbead global challenge we plan the campaign to encourage and facilitate the participation of korean young people and educator before creating the action plan we discussed the values we'd like to deliver to educators and young people through this challenge and we developed the following three co-creation hands-on mind zone playful first we wanted this challenge to be festive for everyone i feel many youth and educators are later comfortable with the concept of competition and every evaluation using the term comfortable may sound strange but it often seems to make people uncomfortable or anxious about how to understand what has been gained through the learning without involving marks and grades in fact while operating the micro bit global challenge many people some parents and educators ask about the evaluation criteria or how to become a winner but rather than competing against we wanted to make everyone become a challenger joining the co-challenge solving the problems we are facing together now to read the micro bit global challenge as a festival we need to organize a group of supporters to work as our colleagues so we made a nationwide oppor for educators who agree with and support our approaches group of 10 educators was first together as a co-leading group then we discussed how we can engage more teachers and young people to participate in this challenge despite the pandemic situation sorry my battery's slow okay pandemic situation then we discuss how we can engage more teachers and young people to participate in this challenge despite the pandemic situation and our final idea was to invite educators to host their own bin hackathon for the following reasons number one every educator can participate regardless of their major subject number two hackathons can be held online without space constraints finally the hosts educators and challengers both can be deeply involved and get into the project even educators are invited to do their own project along with the students as well okay but unfortunately hosting a hackathon was not something most educators were familiar with some teachers thought that they could not participate in the challenge because they were not familiar with software and programming but without that when educators could start to put their hands on the project and struggling with it they would naturally learn how to coach their students to try out their own learning by doing so we need to load the floors and build on own lamp to the hackathon encouraging educators to take courage to be joined as a challenger along with their students so it was quite natural for us to collaborate with a group of artists this time as well i have always been amazed at the ways how artists make their own use of different media and materials to express their ideas like this their playful attitude often provides inspiration not only for children but also for adults to think beyond the box and unleash their creativity we invite artists to play around with microbit along with other materials and suggest some playful approaches we expected this would motivate educators to join the project rather than worrying about their programming skills ahead and eventually we made this this is our map party pack create with a group of artists map is an abbreviation of make make and play m a p map and it is an expression that implies the spirit of hands on my zone we create a party pack for educators which inc which includes materials one can use with up to 10 young people and host a hackathon together of course the party pack also includes microbeads ok i cut the music here because of the copyright also the party pack has several device that can bring the mood of the hackathon let me show you the details yeah the structure can be assembled in many different ways by the user and make their own custom settings it can be used as a workspace and material storage by the way that's me yeah and yeah the party pack contains a wide variety of materials paper straws threads barriers of fabrics cotton and even bottle caps a bunch of everyday materials we hope this would further suggest them to pay attention to their daily object and make use of them as well and continue the creative creation even after the hackathon is over in the case oh i need to wait yeah bunch of materials and educators can host their own hackathon and in case the educator conducts their hackathon online we made it like a piece of sculpture like that can be displayed in the background so that everyone can feel the atmosphere of the student studio or hackathon by the way of course the educators also can do one project right away isn't this an amazing kit i want to some chat here oh yeah thank you yeah so every time i look at it i really appreciate the artist's ingenious idea as much as its artistic spirit thank you again in editing in addition to the map party pack future lab create a step-by-step user guide and video tutorials for educators for educators who are interested in software and coding we made them explore micro bit and also learn a one two one online software sessions to let the educators know that even if they can't code they can flee participate in this challenge wow it's amazing i think yeah oh and yeah come down taiwan okay do you remember i say that i wanted this challenge to be festive for everyone festival should be filled with what fear with choice why so we added elements that the challenger can be enjoyed from the beginning to the end as a microwave champion and also as a creative producer of future land it's a lot of fun for me to play with microbead so during the challenge i became the same challenger like them and conducted weekly challenges for 8 weeks on live streaming creating and introducing creations using my wide imagination about two themes of dual beat 2021 good health and well-being climate action let me introduce you to two of my words my great works the first one is the crying energy saver regarding the subject of climate action i made a device that have people turn up the right or outlet to save electric energy i'm not sure if you can understand it under the crying energy saver that's korean uh the title of the work is actually sometimes i cry when my energy is wasted wasted it is a device that literally cries with tears filled with sadness with the thought of the earth will be in pain if the outlet is turned on for a long time second one is the total leg alarm regarding the subject code health and wellbeing i manufactured a device that helps people to correct their posture through an alarm when they form tall leg for sure like like this you know total leg posture if you put it next to the monitor you can visually check how bent your neck is and if your neck is too bent lights and sounds emit to correct your posture let's look at it together so hmm yeah i made it but it's a really fun and cool piece even when i watch it again i think i'm a little bit genius yeah yeah the quality may look a little bit low quality but it's are intentional amazing because i wanted to create a consensus on the following two things through the weekly challenge first the microbit global challenge aims not to develop innovative products that completely solve problems but to absorb and solve problems that occur in each person's daily life however working on a project is fun and easier than we thought so i wanted to encourage it to everyone put their own hands on it much easier based on this pleasant experience i also learned the online community future levitt because that bit a little bit a bit a little bit leave it simple where challengers can communicate with each other there were challengers who participate every week in weekly challenges with me to share their works and also there were challengers who share the difficulties that occurred during during the project and shared tips they learned while solving the problems and this is the project shared for us the challenge planned and conducted in the spirit of code creation hands on mind zone and playful was hosted by educators where 141 hackathons and 2700 challengers participate and submitted 216 projects perhaps our sincerity has been conveyed even though it was our first time to host this event are these these incredible figures after the challenge finished we had an online showcase with challengers one challenger made a wearing mask alarm based on the air portion levels that are very important for asthma sufferers another challenger made the fishing load for when she got the idea after watching the documentary about ocean pollution also we introduced many projects in the online showcase the challengers have their own ideas and motivations and they try to solve the problems in a variety of ways i could see the challenge become festive for everyone as they started solving the problems with their own hands thousands of people from all over korea participate in the challenge huh challenge however what future lab is paying attention to is not how many people participate in the challenge by attempting to create a new educational culture with educators in the field we have cultivated the foundation to initiate a creative environment movement personally it was very meaningful to be able to support the challenge as a microbe champion and work with many educator colleagues through the challenge we are able to change the perspective of teenagers on creation and coding coding is not simply about learning technical functions but is one of the tools to express one's thoughts and ideas through feedbacks after the challenge i could feel that many young people realize that they could not only use coding but also various materials in their daily lives to express their ideas and creativity or solve the problems their own hands why young people have fun with making stops and creating their own project they also find the seed of creativity which may further lead them to solve the problems they and their neighbors are facing once they have the seed of creativity and fast positive experience in dealing with their own project what would happen when these young people are equipped with professional skills or knowledge i can't wait to see the amazing achievements they are to bring about individually i think i wait in the future lab the young people for 10 years maybe i'm not sure anyway microbeads challenge was a perfect tool to invite everyone not only the young people but also us the educators to discover each of our own little seed of creativity about what we care about and share it with others i believe it will be these little things that would deliver us to a better future thank you for all who have listened to me to the end of the presentation for those who are in the educational challenge i would like to suggest that you create your own challenge and think about ways how to enjoy this challenge journey together well i hope that the story of future lab based on our experiences will lead and inspire you to spread our creative movement wish you well on your challenges and i will continue my challenge as well thank you
