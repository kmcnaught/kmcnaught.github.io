hello everybody and thank you for having us to speak today i'm going to talk a little bit about the impact of our 21st century schools program our 21st century schools program is a program we've been running across the western balkans since 2017. first of all it was a pilot with 60 schools in the western balkans taking part and it was a combination of the british council's critical thinking and problem solving core skills training for teachers combined with giving teachers the skills to teach kids how to code using micro bits the program was initially a really great success much loved by the students and by the teachers and by our partners at the ministry and as a result of some very generous uk government investment in 2018 we received 10 million pounds to um to take the program to all schools across the western balkans and that meant that ultimately we'll be able to work with over a million 11 to 15 year olds in 4 500 schools across the western balkans so the idea of the program was really to give 11 to 15 year old students critical thinking and problem solving skills and digital skills such as coding to enable them to get jobs in the future and to have a prosperous future the beneficiaries were obviously the primary school students themselves but also teachers school leaders school inspectors and pedagogical advisors and policy makers i'll tell you a little bit more about how the program is implemented we run training for school leaders to make sure they are creating the right environment and supporting the teachers within the schools and understand the value of the program and can support and making sure that the ecosystem is there the bulk of the real heart of the program is really a teacher training program and it's making sure that teachers have the skills that they need to teach critical thinking and problem solving skills to students but also are able to use the micro bits themselves and explain how to use them to the students and they complete critical thinking and problem solving training and an online course in how to use the microget as a result of the covid19 pandemic we went from an original blended learning offer to a completely online teacher training program using moodle platforms the program is run with partners uh in the ministries of education and that's how we reach every single school in in each of the countries of the western balkans and it's supported by coding clubs we have over 2 000 coding clubs running across schools around the western balkans and participants of the coding clubs which are 47 of whom are girls take take part in national coding competitions and then we also have a western balkans wide regional coding competition the programme has led to a number of policy interventions and curricular changes across all the countries and it's supported by a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program this is the theory of change for the programme at the higher impact level it's to create more stable economies across the western balkans by equipping young people with the skills they need for the future at the intermediate level it improves the quality of primary education between 10 to 15 year olds and it means that students across the western balkans demonstrate enhanced critical thinking problem solving and coding skills in the short term it means that teachers are embedding and practicing critical thinking and problem solving and coding skills within classrooms and that school leaders are actively supporting the implementation of coding and ctps across the curricula the other short-term outcome is that relevant decision makers develop and implement curriculum and introduce other related policy measures to advance ctps and coding skills in primary schools this gives a snapshot of the program in numbers so we have worked with over 4 000 schools across the western balkans and we have run more than 900 critical thinking and problem-solving training events and over 200 school leaders training events i think around 20 000 teachers have now completed the online microbit course and the moodle-based critical thinking and problem-solving and leadership training courses we've distributed more than 100 000 micro bits across the countries and we have more than 280 validated trainers who have passed the british council's standards critical thinking and problem solving um and as i said this is benefiting more than a million students across the western balkans we believe that the program is unique and the reasons the program is unique is partly because it's the only program in this part of the world that combines the critical thinking and problem-solving training with the digital literacy and coding skills and the practical implementation of physical computing and we believe the two are very complimentary and it's really changed the way that teachers teach in the classrooms and that students experience learning so one of the things we've seen is teachers enjoying teaching more because their students are more motivated and students enjoying learning more and for example this is a nice example of how a chemistry teacher explained the first 20 elements of the periodic table using the microbit it just made it an easier and more fun way to learn one of the other unique things about the program is have made a lasting change and had a real impact on education systems in all the countries in which we're operating there has been curricular changes as a result of this programme and it was the right timing really as we worked with our partners in ministries of education as they introduced coding to the curriculum this is a quote from the prime minister of serbia saying at one of our 21st century schools events that education is an investment in people we are preparing a bright future for the next generations with the brilliant 21st century schools project in serbia teaching children how to think and not what to think the program is very comprehensive and this comes back to making sure that there's the right ecosystem in the program and it's not a one-off intervention due to the size and significance of the funding it's been a four-year program and that's given us the time to work really really closely with our partners in the ministries and to really seek feedback from teachers and school leaders and to tailor the training and the interventions in a way that works for them so it's completely comprehensive because it works with school leaders with teachers with school inspectors because there's no point changing the way that teachers teach if that new teaching skills are not recognized by the inspectors who monitor them and by working with the policy makers the teacher mentoring support has been a really important part of the programme so this is a quote from a primary school teacher in belgrade in serbia who says the main achievements of the project are the awareness of teachers that students can work in a different way for the children this way of working was a more interesting long lasting process and connected them with teachers from different subjects the program gave the idea for the introduction of block classes which were later accepted by two schools in the municipality of lazarevelts a really interesting element of the programme is as a result of the winners of the national coding competitions coming together in a western balkans wide regional um coding competition it's brought lots of young children from these countries together and has facilitated reconciliation and regional cooperation also working on the moodle platform in the wake of the pandemic had educators from all countries working closely together on solutions so that's been a really powerful aspect of the program one of the other reasons that the program has been successful is the use of the microbit itself because the devices are affordable it's meant that we've been able to ensure that more than a hundred thousand have been distributed to schools that means that classrooms have enough for children to work in pairs on projects and that means that everybody gets to have a go and we believe that's one of the reasons why the programme has done well both with girls but also with vulnerable children the kids have really responded to the challenges of identifying a problem and using the microbit to solve it and we've had some spectacular results and we've seen that through our coding competitions this particular example is from a team in montenegro who came up with a invention and it's called system for maintaining an uninterrupted flow in mini hydra power plants using micro computers and actually that has been patented and registered with the ministry of economic development in montenegro which is fantastic result for the programme and for this pair of 14 year old boys one of the other things that make the program unique is there is a really strong evidence that it has positive benefits on vulnerable children this is something that we were picking up by talking to teachers in the margins of the coding competitions and teachers were telling us that this program was enabling them to see talent in some kids that they had previously thought were not very interested in school not very motivated uh not very successful and in some cases given up on and because this leveled the playing field and it was a new type of skills because it was different and a different type of learning this program enabled teachers to spot talent where they hadn't seen it before and really engaged students who are on the margins or in the periphery often from quite low socioeconomic backgrounds it's also had a really powerful impact on girls and one of the things that girls have liked about the program is it has been not just about coding for coding's sake but this holistic idea of identifying a problem within a community fixing a problem and a lot of the uh a lot of the kind of problems that the kids have identified have really been around real issues that schools are facing so it's been issues in the community issues with the environment we've seen lots of micro bit related environmental programs we had a great example of a school in one of the countries where the kids were too cold uh during the winter and they used the micro bit to present a case to the local authorities to to turn the heating up which i thought was a really fantastic and practical example of using a micro bit to get uh a kind of key result i won't dwell on this too much because my colleague nina is shortly going to be talking about the results of a report that we have just published around the impact of the program on vulnerable children so just to go into a bit more detail then this is some of the key achievements of the program so far so there's been around four thousand schools involved more than fifteen thousand teachers trained we've provided plenty of resources including training guides training online and face-to-face guides for how to put your code club together best practices guides lots of different lesson guides and lesson planning tools we've delivered mentorship visits and as i said i think now 20 000 teachers have completed the online microbit course and there's a pool of 283 validated trainers developed the students there are more than 2 000 coding clubs operating and as i said previously 46 of those participants are girls lots of cross-curricular school projects have been introduced and regional national coding challenges organized high quality lesson plans with ctps techniques and coding and lots and lots of fun has been had with the microbet in terms of the school leaders they have received the microbits in the schools they have had their own school leader trainings and materials and and in terms of education policy we have worked very hard to make sure the school inspectors and pedagogical advisors are changed and these changes have been made to the ict curriculum new textbooks have been developed and there's been a revision of some of the digital competency frameworks in these countries and training for ict teachers to implement the new curricula we're now coming to the end of the first phase of the programme um which has been operating now for well since the pilot in 2017 and we are now looking to work with another funder to roll the program out to younger audiences of nine to 11 year olds there's been a huge demand from our partners in the ministries to continue with this program from the kids involved from the parents and it's been a fantastic uh program and we're very grateful to the fantastic collaboration that we've had with microbit so i think i'll leave it there thank you and uh i'll move on to my colleague winner thanks so much claire that was wonderful um we're just trying to get nina to be able to join as a speaker so um we'll just take a moment to do that now and hopefully we can get her on here to be able to share as well so we'll just be a moment claire we're just trying a few more things to see if we can get nina in so i'll report back shortly thanks for your patience i mean nina you made it thank you so much welcome are you able to hear me samina we can hear you on our end are you able to hear us okay sorry i did not hear anything but i understand that you can hear me and apologize for this break because there were difficulties with joining the session for some reason i apologize once again uh hello everyone and greetings from belgrade serbia it's a pleasure to be here today with you at microbit live conference and it's also a great opportunity for us from the british council to be able to present our western balkans 21st century schools program uh i just you have heard a lot from claire because i was not unfortunately able to listen to her presentation and about our impact across the schools primary schools in the western balkans however i will use now the opportunity to talk a little bit more about the impact of the 21st century schools program on vulnerable children the research was conducted based on the facts that we have heard throughout the program implementation that there were very positive effects on one level of children across the western balkans however it was important to say that it is important to say that our original program design was not specifically addressing activities aimed towards vulnerable children however hearing and talking to our uh implementing partners mentors teachers and trainers we have heard a lot of anecdotal stories saying how the pedagogy used within the program influenced uh increased and more engaging participation of children who were understood or perceived as more vulnerable in order to establish whether these observations held any merit we have commissioned independent qualitative research which was performed by a team of regional researchers and which provides provided evidence of what were enablers or inhibited factors for engagement of vulnerable children within our program we were pleased to learn that research findings proved that this scattered evidence we had from our program actually proved true sorry i understand you are not seeing the presentation so just a so nina if you just click on the computer screen there next to your video and your mic options you should be able to to share your screen oh my gosh i hope and trust that you can see the presentation now so uh i will continue uh the findings of the research was based on the analysis of 12 case studies two in each of the western balkans six comprising albania montenegro serbia bosnia and herzegovina kosovo and north macedonia uh the evidence was gathered through interviews with 89 respondents being school teachers principals school pedagogies psychologists pirates and children and vulnerabilities for the purpose of this research were defined in line with the osb cross national classification evidence clearly showed that the 21st century schools program contributed to a higher level of engagement of vulnerable children in the regular schooling process and in some instances it really made real changes life changes for them it had impact on different levels on individual level we saw increase in motivation self-confidence educational aspirations girls from children from rural schools as well as children with disabilities engage with their peers more actively and felt empowered their emotional and psychological well-being also improved it was also evidence that there is impact on peer group and school level which was the following it was around empathy and social sensitivity for disabled peers which increased amongst children children's ability to understand and support the disabled and other disadvantaged peers improved peer collaboration in classrooms and schools increased and school projects that they were doing throughout the program led to community outreach events to promote diversity and inclusion particularly beneficial effects were on girls against the stereotypes in our region that girls are less interested or capable for ict we have tried to document the impact of the program on vulnerable children by presenting some of the most striking testimonials we collected during the research from kids teachers and parents one of the main findings was that the analytical and critical thinking and coding skills increased in all children including the vulnerable children teachers reported visible social distances between children with learning difficulties and other children in most of the cases however through our joint participation in the assignments and projects related to the program not only the children increased analytical thinking and problem-solving skills but they felt equal the feeling of equality comes from facing the same knowledge challenges and this improved overall collaboration and socialization between children from disadvantaged groups and those not belonging to such groups basically learning in a new innovative way which includes new technologies such as micro bits combined with critical thinking problem solving and interactive work with teachers it had major positive effects on all of the children here is a very powerful statement from a girl coming from a very remote rural village in montenegro and her quote is really what makes us really love this program and uh bringing the impact that we do with it so she says now that i've seen that i can do it that i know that i can do everything in my life and this comes following this particular girl actually being the part of the two girls coding team which won the national coding competition second place in the national coding competition in montenegro which qualified them for regional competitions which i'm sure claire talked earlier in her presentations it's important to say that this school has only 53 students and 19 teachers and none of the teachers live in the village whose altogether has only 19 households and this is about why this program is really important because it has entered the most remote schools primary schools in the western balkans we have here also uh it was very important to say that the teacher who was actually establishing the coding club was very enthusiastic and motivated and she wanted to engage all as many children as possible in the coding club so she made a little graph basically saying that in her school 79 percent of girls were showing interest to code only versus 57 for boys so it obviously had an impact on girls to increase their interest in coding and using microbit she also showed that for example in her schools the most interested pupils were from the seventh grade who participated in coding clubs and that a little bit as assumed because children in the higher ninth grade were already preparing for the secondary for the gymnasiums or secondary education had less time for these extracurricular activities i also would like to highlight that within our program thanks to support provided to schools to establish coding clubs based on the data collected more than 50 of the schools involved in the program which is a bit over two thousand established coding clubs with very high percentage of girls participating being on average forty six percent across the western balkans and it's needless to say that using microwave technology in different teaching subjects improved learning outcomes we have seen it in numerous testimonies this is only one of this which says that actually using microbit made kids trying to connect different topics across different subjects and it was realized how they became much more engaged and uh to learn in this interactive and innovative way some of the additional findings which was also very important is that children develop social sense that children develop social uh sensitivity and empathy towards the kids apologies i'm skipping through the presentation faster than i should so children develop social sensitivity and empathy for their peers with disability we have a very nice example uh about this in the school of lazarus which is a small town in serbia we're actually working in peer groups in teams and having specific designated roles children were able to rise in empathy and social sensitivity for disabled peers across the countries empirical collaboration in classroom and its schools led to specific school projects and uh dense school projects to community outreach activities which actively promoted diversity and inclusion the work done to the program greatly influenced the awareness of students especially about the autism in this school's school they have used microbeads to help assistants who were working with autistic children and one of the problems they have identified in the school was that autistic children were sometimes uncontrollably leaving the room so children did the following they have used the microbit which they programmed to link to another sound device and the microwave was sending a signal to another device in case the doors were opening the students later contributed to the celebration of the world autism awareness days in school and these are the pictures where they wear blue shirts being symbol of autism with the veggies which says i exist one also of the very powerful testimonies is about the children from the primary school in a small small part of north macedonia who had severe hearing impaired impairment basically this kid could not hear or speak so according to the words of the school principles uh this program had a great impact on him he was very active wanted to sit work follow instructions and it was amazing basically none of the teachers or principals expected that this kid can be engaged in such proactive manners the positive change noticed also meant that uh this kid was initiating contact with pupils outside of the class and getting more involved in other school activities like arts and he felt empowered he's more involved he started communicating with other pupils he started getting drawing interacting with other children and he before used to be more introverted where now he got involved in the all school activities and this was additional testimony also by his teacher moreover uh the evidence showed that the children increased self-confidence and educational aspirations one of the statements coming from a boy from a city tools like in bosnia and herzegovina from very socio-economic disadvantaged family he's expressing his pride in this success achieved the coding competitions and shared the positive impressions about how his parents were proud of his success at the same time at least now it seems that he became very interested in pursuing his career in electrical engineering uh it's interesting to say that this school for the small city actually won the national uh coding competition and qualified and the regional coding competition and qualified uh to participate in the patch show in london at the emergence of the education world forum in 2019 i believe there is also evidence of improved emotional and psychological well-being of children with learning difficulties and we have learned through the implementation of the program that there is a specific value of collaboration developed both as a skill and as a learning method it does lead to satisfying not only learning outcomes but also satisfying social outcomes as well and this powerful testimony is basically talking about the roma children who usually hurt very isolated not mingling with older children having sitting in separate rooms during the excursions who actually through engagement through the coding club actually became more self-confident realize that they can do some things faster than other children even faster than their teacher and in that sense they become a team with the members of all uh other children in the coding club of course there are a lot of recommendations that came out from this research what we have learned is that acquisition of transfer transfers of skills like ctps and coding requires innovative and pedagogical approaches obviously this has been done by combining the critical thinking problem solving and using the microbit for the first time across the western balance learning coding also proved to be a life skill the program demonstrated that coding is not the skill to be associated with exceptional abilities only but in achievable learning objectives for all children one of the very powerful statements which came out as a recommendation that the microwave should be included systematically throughout the curricula this is important because we have delivered 000 micro bits across primary schools in western balkans however there is need for much more however change will not happen by chance in order to ensure the impact and overnight there is a need to systematically integrate support mechanisms and remove existing barriers which we are all aware there are many in the western balkans the inclusive education started being promoting or included in the legal educational acts around 2009-2010 across the western balance there are a lot of legal preconditions which recognize the need for additional support to vulnerable children however there is still a lot to be done in practice for sustainability more is needed on different fronts from curricular adjustment and mobiling learning methods to support to teachers and improvement learning environments and with this i would like to finalize my presentations but i need to stress out very strongly that the project impact in general and specific on vulnerable children would not be possible without working with highly motivated and dedicated teachers open to innovative approaches and willing to embrace new technologies ready to step out from their comfort zone and change their everyday everyday teaching practice this was important because it was extremely difficult to do those so also in the times of pandemics we have worked with 18 000 teachers across the western balkans and i know that there are many teachers and educators attending this conference today so i would like to say a big thank to all of you for doing the great work with our children i would also like to give special thanks to the microwave foundation who is our partner in this program and who supported us in many ways with project implementation thank you all and i wish you successful continuation of the conference thank you so much nina and claire for a wonderful presentation um rachel in the chat added here that this information you presented today is truly inspirational to hear and i agree so thank you for your time and for sharing this wonderful information with us next up we have interactive sessions so please click leave and return to the sessions area to move to your next session of awesomeness and have a great rest of your microbit event so thank you everyone
