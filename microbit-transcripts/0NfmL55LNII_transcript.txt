hi everyone um i hope you're having a wonderful conference so far i'm excited to talk to you today so i just wanted to start by asking you to close your eyes and think about a child in your life that you really love now i want you to open your eyes and imagine what would happen if that child didn't have access to play now unfortunately this past year we all know how that feels we know all know how detrimental it was when playgrounds closed or school closed and our children didn't have access to um to playing with their peers to going to the playground to enjoying play now i want you to imagine not being able to play was part of a child's everyday life this is the reality for many refugee children around the world refugee children might stay in a camp for years on end sometimes their entire childhood i learned this firsthand when i was working with refugee children in 2018 i had the honor to run a game design workshop this is my background in athens where i'm from in a refugee camp called histone and the first thing i noticed was the camps were packed with kids there were just so many kids around and there was no space for them to play as a designer i went into uh research mode i started looking into playgrounds and and ways to bring play to a refugee camp and i quickly found out it was really really expensive uh and very hard to do so there is this silent play emergency right so providing access to play spaces is not a luxury it's a necessity we know that play is incredibly important and not only a child's emotional well-being but also their learning and their development especially in early ages playing prevents mental health issues for children and it's not just for fun right it's the fuel of social emotional and cognitive skill building play enables caregivers as well to build nurturing relationships with her children so while we were in grief we learned firsthand how transformational play can be for children affected by crisis and as i said the only solution on the market available to refugee camps was playgrounds the same playgrounds me and you have in the cities we live so what if set of building playgrounds which are really costly to maintain and build we thought of play play spaces the same way that we think about legos enter follies foleys are big building blocks you can just put them together just in a few minutes and create a modular system that fosters playful learning and can serve millions of refugee children at a time follies has recently been recognized as a toy of the year finalists as well and it's available for everybody to purchase so there are six key ingredients that make follies really wonderful as a play solution it's a system of large building shapes that enables four play patterns such as running around like you can see construction and also imaginary play it's gender neutral and cultural appropriate it's an out of the box experience and it's made out from a hundred percent on toxin high quality recyclable materials but i wanted to talk about the last ingredient which is the open source license which supports in-country production so you might be wondering how does this fit with a refugee so here i wanted to share um a pilot we did with an amazing organization called alicia in athens greece odyssey has an award-winning vocational training program and i'm just to play the video hopefully you'll be able to see it if not just if you could let me know because i can't see my screen in the chat [Music] now [Music] bye [Music] so i'm gonna actually stop sharing for a minute because i want to take a few questions and then we'll dive back into um oops we'll dive back into the slides so the way the program works is uh refugee youth get trained in this year's vocational training program then they learn how to manufacture their own folly sets which are then distributed in refugee camps so it's a truly holistic program that engages the community from all sides and uses the open source license that follies have so i thought we'll do a fun exercise if that's okay with you um i wanted to um here i'll put again my slide up oops i wanted to ask you what are three ways you could make your own space more playful so take a few minutes and maybe add in the chat three ways you can look around in your space i have many things here that could make maybe my space more playful i mean my studio in dc um and type them in the chat i'll type also the question okay while you're thinking about this question we'll continue um with uh the the rest of the presentation oh there you go play-doh i was i was worried nobody had ideas providing access to safe things to play science encouraging touch and try oh i love this and of course play adding more soft play items color tactile materials and interactive amazing these are great all these are great [Music] great great ideas allowing freedom and creativity amazing okay great so let's continue let me just pull my screen again up and i'm gonna talk now about um another playful project that we are doing in kenya and in which we are also um using microbit so hopefully it will be exciting for those of you uh i see there are a few people from uh nigeria here today and other countries um okay so let me do this again okay and let me know if you cannot see my screen so i wanted to talk about k-play it's a a project that we started this year in partnership with an incredible organization called irex as well as technical partners from the exploratorium and mit media loft lab and tufts university with generous support from the lego foundation so the program aims to serve up to 90 000 students in the coastal areas of kilifian kuala lumpur north of mumbasa in kenya through playful learning programming and teacher training so there are three pillars it's a really big four-year project and i just want to touch a little bit on some of the pillars today and then open it up for questions so there are three pillars in this program there's a teacher training component a community engagement component um so engaging with the parents and the community as well as the community leaders and then the idea of uh creating play labs in schools so pop-up play spaces uh within uh schools in kilifen kuala and i would say if you take one thing from from this presentation today in our approach this program is that we have used co-design as a methodology so instead of us going in and saying okay what what should we do we really involve the community in every aspect of designing this program and i should mention our team humans who play is a technical partner in this project and then irex is the implementation partner and irex kenyan specific is leading all all this work in kenya so co-design as a methodology the way the way the program has worked is throughout the first year we have three training academies in which we bring a woman curriculum a training curriculum to teachers and we test it out we iterate on it and we really get their input as we develop it and there are three kind of core parts of this curriculum first it's really modular so the activities can be used standalone mixed and matched ideally these activities are eventually mixed with coaches and teachers i should also mention that the activities match the national cb cbc framework from the ministry of education they're also flexible so we started this program the year of covet and you know we imagined it would be in-person training and of course we had to do things through zoom and what's up and so we developed a program that you know works in person for small groups synchronously and zooms synchronously on the phone asynchronously offline and adapts in person and big groups um so we're truly looking at programming and activities for uh teacher training that can work across different mediums and then finally we talk about this idea of mirror and model so we really wanted the training to mirror the mindset and behaviors we want to see in children so that is why you know if you see pictures of our program you will see uh you know teachers getting their hands on you know um aluminum foil to make a simple circuits for example or programming in micro bit or programming in scratch and so forth themselves in order to learn how how to do it and to also just get by in on introducing all these engaging tools to their students so i want to talk a little bit about um play labs and the idea of playful space um so i should probably give a little bit of background about myself i'm i'm an architect by training and then i've worked in the field of playful learning for the last maybe 15 years through hardware and software um creative tools and games and toys and all sorts of things and so i'm really interested in this intersection of like space and playful learning so when when we start thinking about the k-play program and how it manifests itself within the schools especially rural uh rural area schools in coastal kenya we were like how can we you know create a scalable model and also sustainable i should add of playful learning spaces in these real rural schools through participation so we start working with the teachers during this teacher trainings and really engaging them on thinking about the space we did a few exercises if we have time we can we can do some of them today together we ask them you know to go to the level of a child and draw elements in their classroom from the eye level of a child we ask them to make a collage of what they think their dream classroom would be and get feedback from their children from the children their students um we really engage them to think of creative ways of of their classroom as a space that facilitates creativity and and playful learning and joy and we also oops and we also looked at um uh local local uh local uh um uh tools and materials that we could include so as we were doing that we were thinking okay um you know we not every school has a space that can be turned into a play lab what can we do and our uh fantastic um k-play director in kenya was oh what if we use one of these push cards um and instead of you know uh having frozen yogurt in them like the one i'm showing you uh from the street in mumbasa we actually put playful learning materials in them so things like micro bits and uh you know circuit uh circuitry components craft materials and so forth so we designed a push card to to do that and go into the class all this is launching in about 10 days so that's why my pictures are mostly sketches we also looked at i asked earlier in the chat what are some ways you could imagine creating your space making your space more playful and uh we created this poster so i think somebody said well maybe words could be something that could help and it's true like simple words these are words from lifelong kindergartens creative spiral um uh framework so even you know words in this space can really put us in the mindset of creativity and playful learning um so these are some of the of the um uh posters that we had in english greek sorry in english and swahili uh and we also developed uh a small play guide that um can come with a play lab and has different challenges like the one you're looking at with the micro bit so what have we learned so far i wanted to share some of the learnings for others who are running similar programs perhaps and also i wanted to offer we have a report on our learnings at humansuplay.comlab if you want to download it as a pdf there so i'd like to start in our learnings with a quote from deborah kimati from the dignitas project in kenya um who also was an early partner in this project and you know one of the things she says is there's only so much a teacher can do without the support of school leaders and so this was really like a pillar in in in the programming we are designing how do we involve the headmasters and the school leaders in this uh really in the end as uh you know trainers of teachers uh to really get full by and if a teacher doesn't feel they have the support of their school it's really hard for them to get motivated to implement such a you know a groundbreaking program within within within their school another thing we learned is that you know learning to step back is essential to understanding the value of play many of you might be familiar with angie play in china's they have developed a method that encourages teachers to step back and learn from their students and and do a lot of observation so teachers really are elevated to the role of researchers and they discover the true value of play for children this can be a really hard mindset to get into so some of the ways we try to encourage it in kenya was we asked teachers to maybe record um the children our play and then we shared that video during the teacher training and and and did this um exercise of observing like what we learned what are they learning while they're playing so the other the other uh thing we learned is that when you propose activities that have many solutions you help shift a teacher's role so a lot of the times we see a teacher you know having this role of you know being the center of knowledge and it's a really hard minds mind mindset to shift especially if you're teaching you know a class of 80 students or 100 students at once uh there are just practicalities in around that but one way to kind of encourage you know encourage a more student-centered approach to it is proposing activities that have multiple solutions so when you have multiple solutions um it strips away the role of the teacher as a sole owner of knowledge and this is a code for from jc edelman from the scratch foundation um the other thing we learned is that teachers can earn their students respect even when they play together so in the university of johannesburg dr linford maltake has been running scratch coding club with his students on the saturdays and these club sessions are thoughtfully designed to match south african culture with moments to share reflect laugh help each other and more the facilitators are no longer called teacher but instead they're referred by students with their scratch name a way to bring down the hierarchy between the teacher and the student so that all can learn together and students can feel comfortable exploring and expressing themselves another thing we learned is around localization so really involving the students and the teacher as part of that effort finally teachers can really be motivated by social recognition from their communities so as we're thinking you know the k play program we're looking at ways that teachers get certified and celebrated and are truly you know uh champions of of innovation in in their communities so you know you can think um about non-financial incentives for teachers like social recognition and public congregations and finding the forum where teachers can get recognized and then finally consider the program as an opportunity for exchange and not transmission of knowledge i think um one one of um my favorite insights was talking to um the founder of mundo maker in brazil whose mission is to bring kind of creative learning pedagogies to public schools and communities in remote areas in brazil and so he talks a lot about the the value of humility and so when you know designing these programs really kind of coming with a humble approach within the community and and also looking to learn yourself right um so how what do we learn as as designers or program implementers um within within a program like this so if you're interested to learn more about all this or if you're interested about playful learning with technology i want to dive right in uh this is where you can find more uh thank you so much this is this is my email and i'd love to get in touch awesome thanks so much chloe that was a wonderful presentation and i think you've left us all feeling inspired going forward so thank you so much for that next up we have a few closing remarks at the stage so please click leave session and you can return to the main stage to catch those final words um thanks so much for joining us today everyone okay thank you there are no questions okay yeah i will share my email and also like does anybody have questions i see there are a few people around yeah we definitely have the time for it so if you have questions you can add those to the chat there and then with children yes that's actually like a big way of how we developed follies we work with children very closely we brought them fun fun story about that initially when we created the solution for the refugee camps we just put a lot of materials in a big box and we called it plain a box and we brought the box to the kids and all the kids were doing were playing with a box and none of the materials inside so we start thinking okay what is like something that we can create that is more durable than a cardboard that imitates kind of the same uh feeling and so uh in a way it's amazing to co-design with children because they they come up with these ideas and they know better than anybody else um what they find engaging and fun the group the group of kids were i would say four to seven four years old to seven years old so um a preschool kindergarten early elementary how did you decide on the ice cream cart over other ways of getting materials around this was truly an idea by carol the program director in kenya we were problem solving we were thinking okay we have a very small small you know budget for for these play labs and then we were also thinking of the realities of schools that don't have a dedicated space or the space is super run down or sometimes because there is no space you need to have these sessions outdoors um so you know there's a ton of push cards around mombasa and we were like oh what if you know what if we use that and the wheels are really big so you know they can go um in unpaved streets uh so that's that's how we came up with that idea yes there's definitely a lot of design thinking uh behind this and iteration as we go did you follow an established model for grade level age level progression of structure play to align play atmospheres with curriculum expectations for grade do you mind elaborating a little bit so i think a lot of i think if i understand this correctly you're asking if um if the activities we design are quite structured to match maybe with a formal school curriculum if that is a question i would say this is our next step so one of the things we learned this year from working with teachers i see as students get older okay one of the things we learned with teachers this year was their need to actually have a little bit more structure play that matches um specific lessons that they're teaching so for a lot of them they they do this during an actual um classroom session so having more structured activities that doesn't mean you take away their creativity it's more just practically thinking um you know how do you structure activity so children are in groups or they have a very specific learning goal perhaps that matches a specific lesson plan or cbc standard i think with in regards to age so like as students get older more structured but still play focused this is an interesting question so one of the other projects our studio works on that i didn't mention is um with the national academy foundation which works primarily with high schoolers and it's all about getting high schoolers uh prepared for jobs and and college and so you would think okay high schoolers like you can't really do playful learning things with them because you know they're almost adults and you know they don't think about um let's say you know more open-ended play but we have found that um you know uh students of all ages really um really are more engaged when they have a playful learning experience and the reason for that is we i think it stands for all humans but you know when somebody tells you to learn something because you have to you're much less likely to do it whereas when the experience is presented as fun and and the great thing about play is that even when you introduce maybe serious topics like getting a job that might be stressful or like an internship um and so forth um it really kind of demystifies that and and puts you in a mindset where you know you're more you're more relaxed you're more open-minded you start kind of um getting into a more engaged kind of state of mind great any other questions i see jim you work with irex on other human center on high school projects and we call it tinkering yeah there's many ways to call this i would say even with playful learning i think one thing we learned is that uh people respond better to creative learning than playful learning so sometimes it is play but we call it creativity or tinkering or whatever makes sense for that community and i think that's fantastic let's see if there are other questions thanks so much chloe this is great great well don't hesitate to get in touch um i think my email is in the chat uh and yeah i'm always i'm always up to uh learning more about what other people are working and helping as much as we can awesome thanks everyone have a great day
