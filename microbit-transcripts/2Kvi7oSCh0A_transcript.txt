https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="2Kvi7oSCh0A
okay okay great um well thank you very much uh i am as as he said john maloney uh lead developer microblocks and i would have been joined today by emily st germain from the cambridge public library but for reasons that she will explain herself in the video she couldn't be here today our third sort of virtual presenter would be katie henry who actually helped develop these ideas really really over the last year and a half katie and i have been working to develop exploring electronics with the micro bit um and unfortunately katie couldn't be with us because she's leading some kind of micro bit live conference today so she can't she couldn't join this presentation um anyway uh the micro bit is a fantastic tool for exploring electronics it can be used as a power source it can be used uh to turn things on and off with the with the with the pins it can be used to generate signals it can sense voltage and it can even graph voltage over time to study time varying behavior such as the charge and discharge cycle of a capacitor we think that there's so much possibility here that we emily and i started talking about creating a four-session workshop about electronics that uses the microbit as a tool the workshop would be aimed at grades us grades four through seven which is uh ages nine through twelve and uh we're trying very hard to recruit very deliberately from non-techy families uh we don't want just the children of engineers and scientists and harvard and mit professors but i'll let emily tell you a little bit more about that herself in this video that she created great so um i hope you can now see my screen again um thank you very much emily and uh she'll be watching this she'll be sort of participating as soon as she can watch the the recording of it well as emily said we've got four sessions in our um in our workshop and uh every session has associated with it some kind of project that you build some kind of hands-on thing and at the same time the students will be learning important principles so the first project is to make a very simple led light circuit and uh and they'll also be learning the principles of things like what makes a complete circuit and the difference between conductors and insulators in the second session we'll introduce the micro bit as a way to control things and will make a micro bit controlled traffic light the third session will turn towards voltage and we'll learn what voltage is and how you can measure it and how you can make a volt meter that will measure the the quality of your batteries so you can tell a good battery from a not so good battery and we'll also make a potato battery that can actually light up an led the final session will focus on resistance and we'll talk about how resistors can be used to make a musical keyboard that can play six notes so uh the rest of this i'm actually going to dive in and show almost all of this stuff live so let me go ahead and show my camera view and i'll start talking about these different sessions and how we're going to build things so this is these are the materials that we'll use to build the led light circuit and some of them came from a hardware store this uh coil of 24 gauge soft brass wire doesn't need to be stripped bends really easily can be cut with scissors that came from a hardware store these paperclips and brads came from an office supply store this is a piece of chipboard that has been laser cut to have a circuit on it and some little holes to put brads through and then finally we've got a few components that came from an electronics electronics mail order place mouser electronics so we've got resistors and light emitting diodes all of these things are very inexpensive and that was like part of our goal was to make sure that uh that this could be replicated in classrooms uh or other after-school centers for not very much money so all of these components like for example the led is 10 cents the resistor is 5 cents the brad's five cents the paper clips a few cents everything is really really cheap um the most expensive thing in this particular circuit is the battery holder which is a dollar fifty or so um and of course the batteries to go in it but we're only using the battery holder in the first project so that kids will have something to take home because normally the micro bit can be used as a power supply so here's what they'll build and as i said the idea was that we wanted something that they could take home that would be standalone so it would work even without a micro bit so it's a simple simple circuit that will light up this led when i close this switch that was made out of the paper paperclip so embedded in this is actually a bunch of electronics principles so one of them is this idea of the difference between conductors and insulators so the chipboard the backing is an insulator as is the plastic coating on these wires but inside of the wires is actually metal and metal conducts electricity most metals conduct electricity quite well so that metal is a conductor and it's inside of those wires likewise the brads the paperclip the leads on the led and the resistor those are all made out of metal so what you need to make a circuit is you need a loop circuit sort of means loop so you need a way for the electricity to come from the battery through the red wire through the paper clip through the led through the resistor and then back through the black wire to the batteries if you don't have a complete circuit nothing works the light the led doesn't come on so that's like a basic principle in every circuit that you ever build you have to sort of be able to trace the path of the electricity from the power source all the way through some components back to the uh the other the negative side of the power source okey doke so um uh before i leave this i wanted to just talk a little bit about the construction techniques so um so here's an led light circuit this one i actually modified to uh to be powered by a micro bit just just so you can see how that might work what i did was i i bent the ends of the brads over to make contacts on the edge of the board that you could connect alligator alligator clips to to make these circuits what you do is um is you insert a brad through the hole where brad is and then and then you wrap what i like to do is kind of put it most of the way down and then you wrap the lead of the component like this resistor around the brad and uh then you'll when you're done with that connection you'll fold these out but actually in this case i have another thing that i have to connect which is the led so the led has one leg that's longer than the other and that one has to go towards the positive side so we're going to put another brad in here and i'm going to hold the led in place and just kind of wrap that around like so and wrap it around um around this brad like so now i'll turn it over and i'll uh use my fingernail to separate these guys oops so that's one and this one push them down nice and tight and here's our finished circuit so if i connected this up to a microbit we'd be able to turn this led on and that these uh it's actually was pleasantly surprised that these brads make very good connections um with with like bare wire and leads these circuits are more reliable than some circuits i've built with for example copper tape or conductive thread so this construction technique seems to be working nicely okie doke well that would be the first class was basically introducing basic circuits the next class we would do would would involve using the micro bit to control stuff so i have a little circuit here so this is the traffic light circuit and as you can see um we're using alligator clip wires to connect from pins zero one and two to zero one and two on the board again i use that technique where there's a little bit of the brad bent over that makes a place that i can connect the alligator clip to and then we also have to have a ground to make the circuit be complete when i turn this on you'll see that the green led lights up and the students will write a short a very simple program to sequence this so that when you press this button we go yellow and then red and this will take us back to green so they have to go to yellow wait a little bit change to red and then when you click green they have to turn off red and turn on the green led so this is all done with just a few blocks in microblocks or make code and you know and yet it's very powerful it's like you know you can understand like how a traffic signal works and you could even extend this by for example uh adding radio remote control so that with another micro bit you trigger uh the traffic pattern to change and maybe it automatically goes back to green after after uh say a minute after you've crossed the street so that's super powerful that would be the second session the third session is going to introduce voltage and let me get this out of the way and start microblocks so here we have a little microblocks program uh that that will report the voltage on pin one so we're using the analog pin read analog pin block which returns a number between 0 and 1023 and then this little bit of math is going to convert that into hundredths of a volt so uh 1.5 volts would read as 150 and uh we'll just go ahead and start this up right now and let's see you can't see the mic bit at the moment so here's a micro bit and what i'm going to do is i'm going to connect the yellow wire to pin one because that's our sensing i've still got to have a ground and i'm going to use this to measure the voltage on some batteries so here are some batteries and what i want to do is i want to kind of get a sense of uh like how much voltage a battery is putting out by the way you'll notice that this number here this is the the reading from from the pin converted to a voltage and it's kind of wiggling around a bit that's because this isn't connected to anything so it's what's called a floating input which means it's not really well defined exactly what number it should be giving it's kind of picking up random electrical noise from the environment but if i touch this to the 3 volt pad you get a nice steady 320 which means 3.2 volts that's the power supply voltage from the micro bit when it's plugged into usb if i touch it to this ground thing we get zero because ground is our sort of zero reference voltage is always measured relative to some to some other thing so let me measure the voltage of this battery this battery is a partly used battery and i'm going to do that by holding the the ground against the base of the battery and touching the yellow lead to the top and then reading the number that i'm getting so i'm seeing numbers like 1.45 1.46 so that basically or actually 145 but that means 1.45 volts or so so this is supposed to be putting out 1.5 volts but it's a little bit lower because this battery is partly used let's take a look at a really brand new battery what does that put out so this brand new battery is putting out 1.69 1.7 so it's putting out more than 1.5 volts so a fresh battery actually puts out a little bit more than 1.5 volts and here's a here's a very old battery that i took out of a micro bit um uh it had you know actually stopped working like the mic the battery was so dead um but it's not zero volts it's actually still putting out 1.2 volts but that when a battery is is getting old that's what happens its voltage drops down to you know less than one 1.2 or less than 1.2 volts um using this volt meter you could actually go through all the batteries in the micro bits in your classroom and figure out which ones actually needed to be replaced and which ones actually could be used for a little while longer so instead of for example replacing all the batteries because you're not sure and you want to make sure they all work you can actually make sure you get your money's worth out of all your batteries okay so um let me clear the decks here a little bit the next thing i want to show is how to make a battery out of a potato well it's actually not just out of a potato it's out of these other things so these are galvanized nails galvanized nails are coated with zinc and zinc is a great electrode for making batteries and pennies which are copper which is another great other electrode for batteries so a battery consists of two dissimilar metals and and then some kind of electrolyte the potato is going to provide the electrolyte so potatoes contain something called phosphoric acid and uh that acids tend to make good electrolytes at least with copper and zinc electrodes so i'm going to plug put a nail a penny in one side and a nail in the other and uh let's let's connect this to the to our voltmeter and see what happens so the the nail is the negative and the copper is the positive of this little battery so if i connect that up i'm getting 76.77 so that's basically 0.7 volts i know from experience and also from theory that an led needs something like about 1.8 volts in order to light up so one potato actually we call a single unit like this a cell one potato cell is not enough to light up an led but we can we can improve this so what we can do is we can add more potato cells to create a potato battery and the way we're going to do that is we're going to we're going to um we're going to put these cells in series so one of the the lessons earlier would have been uh series and parallel circuits so kids will get a chance to sort of um practice what it means to put things in series so i'm gonna make these different cells and then i'm going to grab some alligator clip wires short these are short alligator clip wires which are really great for things like this so to connect the cells up we want to go from copper to zinc or to nail penny to nail copper to zinc from each cell and that's going to add the voltages up so we're going to get the voltage of this cell added to this cell added to this cell and i think four four cells should be enough to light our led but we're going to find out [Music] okie doke so let's actually before we try the led let's let's measure the voltage at different places so if i measure the voltage here well actually let's start with the very first one yeah it's still putting out about point six or seven point seven volts if i measure it here i'm getting 1.35 volts so basically it's kind of like .65 times two if i measure it here i'm predicting it's going to be about that times three yep it's uh 2.3 volts so that probably is enough that's probably just over the threshold to light our led and this one actually gets all the way up to 3.2 volts at least with nothing connected to it now the voltage of a battery will sometimes drop a little bit when you connect it up to a load so let me see i need another alligator clip i think i'll use this red one here so i'm going to use this red alligator clip and i'm going to put another white one on here so the red one is positive and here's this led and as i mentioned earlier the longer leg of the led this one's slightly longer that's the positive leg so we'll connect that to the red alligator clip and if all goes well when i connect this it should light up see did so we're actually making enough electricity to light that led it's not super bright uh but it's pretty amazing that you can get electricity straight out of a potato now this was for potato cells oh actually i didn't connect i should have connected this to the copper that's even brighter there we go so i was actually inadvertently only using three cells um let's go back and see if it would work with just two cells when i connect this here i'm actually ignoring it's not actually put using the voltage from those two extra cells it's just using the voltage from these two cells and that led is pretty not lit it's actually not lit at all so with three cells we get dim dim light and with four cells we get pretty bright so i've always thought this this was a very cool experiment um and you can use lemons instead of potatoes but uh potatoes actually they don't they don't make a lot of juice so they're less messy and uh maybe more important they're actually a lot cheaper than lemons i think potatoes are like about 10 cents each and lemons are often like 50 cents each so if you're getting a whole classroom worth of potatoes or lemons that actually is a consideration um however i will say that i talked to one teacher earlier this week about having done the lemon experiment and she said after she did uh making a battery out of lemons uh her classroom smelled lemony fresh so there is that about lemons okay let's go on to the third class which is sorry that was the third class the fourth session is going to talk about resistance so to sort of explain resistance i made this special little circuit here and i'm going to just use the micro bit for this as a power supply so to do that i'll just connect this yellow lead to the plus three and to plus three of the circuit um then ground of the circuit and actually we don't need the micro bit blocks program we're just looking at the circuit here so let me actually just put that there we have three resistors here 100 ohms 1k which is how we write a thousand ohms and 10k which is how we write 10 000 ohms and we have this little paperclip that can switch between them so with 100 ohms which is a small amount of resistance we actually it doesn't resist the electricity very much so this smaller amount of ohms makes more electricity flow and we get a very bright led if i switch to this you see it's actually dimmer because we have 10 times as much resistance and then finally 10 times that resistance is even a little bit dimmer in in real life the difference between those is more dramatic than it looks through the camera but um but you can definitely see that that's brighter than that and somewhat brighter than that so that basically introduces the idea of resistance and then we're going to take that into um into a a circuit and we're going to use that we're actually going to use a chain of resistors to uh to make a musical instrument so this is this is basically a little keyboard uh probably with like one dollars worth of components including the the five resistors which are about 25 cents and i'm using um paperclips as the keys of this little keyboard and i put a strip of corrugated cardboard under them to leverage them up so that by default they're actually sitting a little bit above and not making contact with the brads that they're over okay so let's um let me open up a different micro blocks project and sort of explain how this is going to work so uh probably the quickest way hey john just want to let you know you have five minutes or so left oh i thought i had till 20 after oh you're right i have five minutes left right i'm on my last thing okay go for it okay so um thanks for the reminder so uh so i'm gonna uh basically show this graph this uh this the output of this so so when nothing is connected i'm actually getting 1023 so this is raw numbers as opposed to voltage if i press this key oops i have to connect this up so pin one to pin one ground to ground um if i press this then i've got a straight path from pin one to ground so we're basically grounding pin one and we get a zero if i press this i get a big number um and if i press some of these intermediate ones i'm getting different numbers and over here on the graph actually if i say zero at bottom you'll see this is the lowest number this is a medium number this is higher higher higher higher and with no key connected it goes all the way up to 1023 so that way i know nothing is connected i'll start this program which is going to use those numbers to make musical notes and i'm going to hold the micro bit close to my headset so that you can hear it hopefully the wires let's see okay here we go um [Music] so there we have a musical keyboard made for about a dollar's worth of components uh and and the micro bit and it really works uh see i have okay i have i have just enough time i think to do one more thing so i want to show that that would be where our class ended um uh but i wanted to show one quick thing about capacitors just uh to show what's possible if you go a little bit beyond in a more advanced class what might be possible so this is a circuit that i made that shows will show the charge and discharge curve of a capacitor and the way it works briefly is that pin 2 is going to be used as a switch to sort of send electricity into the capacitor or to drain it out of the capacitor through this one ohm resistor um so actually i'm going to move this off screen because there's not much to see but there will be stuff to see on the graph so when i press the a button uh it should start graphing oh it's it started graphing oh let me put zero at the bottom okay when i press the a button the capacitor charges and you notice that it didn't happen immediately and when i press the b button it discharges so let me actually i'm i'm not pressing the buttons but i will a b and then i'm going to stop so this graph that you get this kind of rising curve and falling curve that's the charge and discharge curves of a capacitor and it works at any time scale i'm using kind of a big capacitor so that we can actually see this but one more kind of cool thing that you can do is if i charge this capacitor up and i stop this i'm going to actually discharge the capacitor through this led and if if i do this right let's see get this on the screen so you can see it you should see a little flash as the capacitor discharges through the led and there you have it so the capacitor stored some energy and we just charged it through the led all right with that and one minute left i will wrap up and see if there are any questions i'm going to stop sharing fantastic presentation john there was some questions around um where the best place to find resistors are whether it's a hardware store if it is electronic component store well sadly radio shack is no longer in business um so you can't just go to your local radio shack um but there's a bunch of mail order places i got these from mouser electronics i think they're actually pretty uh pretty decent um you can also get resistors from and leds from places like adafruit electronics and maybe sparkfun um those are good places uh mouser probably has the best prices because they're like a big you know wholesaler oh yeah rs online yeah i mean you can get also digikey you can get to more and more sort of serious electronics places mousers kind of in between i think their website's a little easier to use than um than digikey for example but they still have a huge selection of different things oh i was going to say um i actually have i made a resource guide um for anybody who wants to try some of these things uh let's see can we share this link in the chat that would be fantastic and just to honor time as there's about a five minute transition john the best place if you can use yet you're using the chat to connect or follow you um there's such an inspirational comments and connections to the approach and you're learning design in terms of how you're exploring and sharing and democratizing those opportunities for easily easier access with that mindset it's incredible so any any ways to type to tap into the micro block platform and or follow your journey would be appreciated yep absolutely um so so actually you can apply all of this with other software besides microblocks although i think the graphing works rather nicely in microblocks and uh i put in this folder i put sort of a synopsis of the course as well as all of the um all the uh circuit board layouts that are we're using and the micro blocks programs so feel free to explore that and i sorry went over a minute or so thanks for your expertise i'm gonna check out please use the chat and connect with john through the various channels here and uh for the rest of you here there'll be more sessions uh coming at you so please go check out the session area and thanks again john for an incredible presentation thanks everyone thanks for
