oh all right i'm ready don't worry uh a brilliant timing because uh i'm the cat hello i'm daniel i'm i'm kev square but i'm a confused person jeez i'm a confused person and i i can rarely remember who i am and what i do and everything so uh when i hold workshops i have this uh short video that i like to show the participants that helps explain who i am and it also helps me remember it so i'm going to show that video to you here and of course i've heard that the videos don't work so great um so if if the video is not working so great then there's the link to the video so you can watch it at your own leisure um and here's the video on on the screen hello i'm captain creator of the microbits orchestra over the years as a musician and maker i have made countless different musical instruments ranging from musical helmets [Music] and candle powered synthesizers [Music] to wireless robots [Music] and self-playing circuit boards [Music] some of my instruments work really great [Music] others work also not so great as the ones that work really great by making my own musical instruments i can decide to a much further extent exactly what the music is going to sound like and what it is going to look like when i play the music in front of people that are looking at me this goes for all tools you make not only musical instruments but hammers and nails and fake nails and other things as well what i'm trying to say is that being able to make things that you can use to make things with is a really great and i want to teach you how to do that that's why i've made the micro bit orchestra and using the micro bit orchestra you can make robots and make code easily that can play music and bang on things and send radio messages and it's you want to control a robotic xylophone by touching bananas it's okay [Music] [Laughter] you can do that that's okay it's not hard it's easy and it's quite fun okay so uh i that helps me at any rate and it might not help a lot of you but it helps me uh remember a little bit uh who i am what i'm doing and uh so basically i think what i was trying to say in the video is that i i'm a musician and artist and uh and for me like a really important part of being a creative person you know i'm somebody that creates art is uh has been to to create the tools uh that i make make up with because i've been i've been a musician for at least 20 years now uh and i've also you know made a lot of uh you know sculptures and uh and and arts in other fields as well not just music and you know everything from like club concerts uh to uh contemporary arts festivals which was actually the most recent concert i played was uh at a contemporary the oslo contemporary arts music festival sorry festival of contemporary music my first one is called where i actually used uh microbit uh the micro bit orchestra uh a bunch of robots to play the piece it was a piece for 34 speakers and uh about 50 robots with that was all controlled using microbiome micro bits sorry um so uh basically uh i've always created my own tools when i make music and it became very important for me from from quite an early stage in my in my musical career and and it had the reasons i started making it aren't really the reasons that i continued making it because to begin with it was a little bit out of necessity uh buying music gear is expensive and uh and also because i wanted to make different music i wanted to to be um for a start i was making music on a computer and basically making music on a computer back then the way you were supposed to perform that was just like sit behind a laptop and press play and then you know let the beats come out of the speakers and check your email and play minesweeper while they are well the crowd kind of enjoys your music and i wasn't really interested in doing that i wanted to play music in a more kind of explanatory way and and be a little bit more engaging both for my own sake and for the audience as well so so and in order to do that i i basically i felt i had to create my uh my own uh instruments um and so this is kind of what it looks like it's a bit loud this is what that's what it looks like when i when i play a concert there [Music] it's also actually a concert i played using loads of uh micro bit robot things that's actually that's an installation as well uh that's the installation in in tromso in the museum in trump's the science museum in drumser that they use for both concerts like that and for educational purposes for teaching kids to program because it's all because it's all micro bits hanging on the wall then anybody can program their micro bit to send radio messages and control the micro bits on the wall and um yeah so this is actually this is quite late in my in my career as a musician i think i've got some pictures here of what it kind of looked like in the in the olden days when i used to build musical instruments uh this is when i was a kid uh this is like this is the old the oven from the wall uh in the uh flat that we moved into um is bit yellowed because the guy that owned the flat before his diet from cancer because everything was yellow in the flat covered with thick layer of yellow um and then uh over the years as i've been making all these instruments of course uh i've beca i put a lot more thought into what the hell i was doing i guess and and i also uh ended up teaching a lot of people how to build musical instruments um and for me by then it had become uh the important aspect of building these instruments was to try and take control to a certain extent over the creative process because i realized uh quite early on that the the music or the what what you create with music or or in any creative form or even if it's not creative even if it's not a an art form that you're working with then then the result of what you make is determined in part by the creator or the composer in the musical uh situation and part by the tools that the composer uses and often almost equally much uh depending of course on how you evaluate it uh equally uh much affected by these two uh different uh things uh and then of course the third thing that that i always uh well at least that i always thought was important especially for uh for music and compositions is is the audience or the people that are experiencing the the piece of art or the uh the creation uh and it's it's very evident as a musician as soon as you step on stage and start playing music in front of people that the reaction to the people and the the i mean i hate to use the weird words like the energy in the room uh but the the interaction between the artist on stage and the audience plays an enormous role in in the music that's created and of course the interaction between the musician and the tools that he uses so i started using uh this step of creating tools as a as a conscious uh part of the creative process when i when i was making music and i also ended up teaching a lot of other people how to build musical instruments and how to build electronics because other people saw what i was doing and thought it was interesting and wanted to to try it for themselves um so as of studying things i only ever studied like phonetics and fine arts and things that aren't really 100 related to the kind of stuff i ended up doing and i'm self-taught in electronic and really largely in music as well i mean i had piano lessons when i was a kid but apart from that i didn't really study a lot um but for me i found out that when i was creating these tools when i was learning programming and learning electronics i was far more motivated by the the sort of allure of learning a new skill and being able to create something that i wouldn't be able to create if i didn't learn this technology if i didn't grasp how how these things worked uh as opposed to being told that you have to learn something or learning something to solve an explicit problem that somebody has given you that you have to learn you have to learn javascript because i've told you to make a webpage and you have to make this thing move for instance uh for me it it really works a lot better if if if the goal for learning something is that i'll be able to create something that i wouldn't be able to create if i didn't learn this skill and and i realized that this was also working for other people that i was teaching that if they if the incentive to learn something was that they'd be able to create with what they learned then people are a lot more interested in actually understanding and and uh you know learning these new skills um so yeah i'm reading notes over here so i was very interested in in this relationship between the the artist and the tool and the the audience and i like to call it the point of interaction which is where the kind of the artwork or the what is being created uh appears in the point of interaction between the the artist or the composer if it's a musician and the tools and the audience uh it doesn't really live in any of the other places and uh in and and i've really brought this into my artistic process in a lot of very explicit ways as well as i mean when i release music now um i always release music on circuit boards and the circuit boards are like this one right here which is a circuit board where the person who buys the circuit board uh plugs it in and uh let's just skip to the bit where they plug it in and when plugged in it generates uh music by itself uh but it also invites the user to push these different buttons and to create their own melodies and rhythms and make their own music um let's see is yeah like i'm trying to do there [Music] let's see over here oh no maybe there we go here we here i'm making a melody on the device so if i'm the user making the melody on the circuit board which is the music that the artist has released then i'm as an audience member participating in a very great part but then on top of this uh the circuit board itself it's um every time you turn it on it makes a new song it's just got algorithms that i've written and it uses those algorithms and random numbers to to create uh completely new music every time you turn it on and when the user that has bought this ep release basically this musical release starts interacting with him pushing the buttons and waving in front of the light sensors then of course the user is also controlling the music and making the music and becoming a collaborator in the in the artwork but then the device itself this circuit board will occasionally delete things that the user has used so if i'm a user and i bought this and i'm making a melody then the circuit board will sometimes change the melody they've made or remove some notes or add some notes or transpose or sometimes just delete everything and start fresh which then puts the actual circuit board and it's you know it's sort of a i of course can't call it ai it's just an algorithm it's not very complicated at all but it's unpredictable and and it itself the tool is very much uh taking control over the the work of art the finished product so to speak um so for me it's always been important to be able to sculpt the process here of uh of my own creative process sorry and uh and and take control of the creative process by by building the tools and i realized that this translates really well in my mind at least to to what i was doing with these uh with these workshops as well where uh not only was this a great incentive for other people but the tools that i was using to teach these workshops were also very instrumental in in how i was teaching so in the same way as i can see uh an artwork being the sum of or the points of interaction between the composer and the tools and the audience then the um the teaching or the the uh the emergence of knowledge in people becomes uh happens at the point of interaction between a teacher and his pupils and the tools that he uses to convey the knowledge about about what he's talking about i mean for music the obvious example would be like playing a guitar the composer is limited to playing six notes at a time and if he's playing in front of an audience there is the with the mosh pit where people are head banging then is he's not gonna play you know classical music uh very likely and in the same way uh it's very difficult to convey uh the meaning or the you know the the underlying nature of mathematics without using an abacus or without using stones you can count with or without using your fingers uh the tools play a very important role in in being able to create knowledge in people i'm i'm uh i'm an artist uh i don't know if you noticed i'm not like um i'm not a uh an educator of absolutely that's a lot of what i'm saying is probably it sounds very um philosophical and out there um but yeah the let's have a look at the stuff i've done then with all this with this uh artsy fartsy way of uh thinking about how to teach people and how to create stuff i've got some links here yeah so so i already kind of introduced the micro bit orchestra in the beginning there with that little introduction video uh and and there is an installation in uh in oslo that we can actually you can actually go online i can post the link to that as well in chat you can go online and kind of interact with uh let's see how do i open this link there there we go uh interact with this kind of 3d installation of uh of the uh of the installation that is in uh oslo in their uh techno techit uh what is it technology sorry you i can't remember uh in one of their spaces for for teaching so here you can see like the classroom with all the uh students there and then on the wall here there's different robots hanging around that play music and and this in this interactive map you can kind of move your finger over different things and get a little kind of demonstration of uh how the different robots work and what they do and whatever um so this so this is a tool that's used both for my own sake for creative expression i've written the music for for this installation and others and also as a tool to to teach programming and electronics and music um so the backbone of this is is kind of the micro bit orchestra programming what you call it uh the micro bit extension is what it's called micro bit orchestra micro bit extension uh that looks like this where you have all these blocks for making things things some things are simplified a lot to to be able to convey musical concepts like this is a little step sequencer that if i if i load it onto a micro bit like this one here uh wait a minute like this one here then uh huh let's go like this then this step sequencer these two step sequences are now synchronized to each other because like there's a master clock in the room and then i can like make the sequence on this and then that will be played on let's turn this camera on so you can see so there's a robot over there playing it and it'll play in sync with of course other things but this isn't really what i was going to tell it to you about today it's just kind of the uh what you call it the uh framework or the where i am now and why what's happened now has happened because uh i'm a huge synth nerd as probably several people that are watching here can uh can agree with um and i mean i could show you other videos of installations and different uh things i've made and uh oh actually let's have a look at this i made some robots sorry i'm not very i'm not i'm not sticking to the script here am i if i got it no how this does not work wait a minute there go to the page put it there like that here are some other robots that i made to teach programming where kids can build these little rabbits and the little rabbits sit on things and drum but of course you all remember this because i i did this in in uh in england in manchester uh some years ago when we play i played a concert and these rabbits were playing along so i don't need to explain all this stuff instead let me show you uh something cool because uh like i was saying i'm a huge synth nerd and that's why there's all these uh synthesizers behind me uh which i like to play on as much as possible and and for me being able to it's like understanding music and sound is is very integral to what is what attracts me to mathematics i think really um so i've been thinking for a long time is it possible to to do this stuff on on the microbit and uh for a long time it hasn't really been possible uh and believe me i've tried really hard to do like proper synthesis on on the microbit version one and it just it wasn't happening well people have managed to do it but what i want to do is i want to be able to to do the synthesis and i want to be able to control it using make code you know i want to i want kids to be able to use this brilliant uh id this programming environment and uh and make music on synthesizers or make synthesizer music with micro bit and as you all know the microbial is limited to playing one note at a time and that note is a kind of annoying square buzzing note or is it limited to that because what i've managed to put together with with the amazing help of uh of tom johansson from northam who is a brilliant programmer that has really dug into the nitty-gritty guts of the microbit to make this happen uh here we have a uh what's called a subtractive polyphonic multi-timbral synthesizer with sample playback support running on the micro bit so let's try and so what i've got here right on the left is it says a bunch of things like set preset user one parameter oscillator shape to zero set precipitate and basically what i'm doing here is i'm programming in what the sound is going to sound like uh this is not what it's going to look like in the end there's there's gonna be both uh sounds that you can just choose from like different cool sounds you can choose from or uh and a much more user-friendly interface for making your own sounds if you do want to learn how to make sounds but what i've basically done here is i've set up a synthesizer voice called user1 to have all these parameters and then i can add uh this trigger note let's use this to uh to play a note and let's start with 69 and then let's trigger the note but let's also give it a pause i might not this is like i don't want it to last for a second let's say 200 milliseconds and add uh pause after it's 500 millisecond pause let's see and now i'm going to download this to my synthesizer synthesizer i've started calling it a synthesizer it's a micro bit really uh which is here and as you can tell i've connected uh two crocodile clips to uh to the micro bits uh zero and ground pins and when i click download here then hopefully we should get a note coming out of the micro bit when it's done uh some it takes a bit of a while to compile the first time often um but luckily we have uh oh there we go and now it is playing a note which sounds i don't if i don't if you agree but i think this sounds a lot nicer than the notes used to sound uh on the micro bit um just turn that down a bit and let's try to play another note as well at the same time as the first note so let's play another note that is no number 74. at the moment it's just not numbers later there'll be more of a graphical interface to to do this so let's oh and let's also i always forget to do this or i always like to do this let's add like a little symbol here so we know what's been downloaded we download this to the micro bit and there we get our plus and it is playing two notes at the same time i hope you can hear these notes because they're beautiful but we don't have to stop it too let's add another one let's add one that is note number 81 for instance download that that was an octave above so i can't really hear that very well let's add another note shall we let's add note number 90 on top of that should we add another one let's add another note on top of these ah these are a thousand so we're starting to lose notes now because these notes are lasting for a whole second and then they're being retriggered every half second so we're getting twice as many notes being alive at the same time but if i cut it down we should be able to hear them i i think this is amazing and then of course i can change this let's see let's say we want this oscillator to be or let's say we want this oscillator to be a triangle wave instead [Music] let's say we want this to be twice the frequency of the first oscillator [Music] let's say that we want it to last much longer so a release time of one second and it's doing that i forgot to point out because i've just got so used to it now uh but all of you probably noticed that this isn't working in the simulator at all at the moment and and every time i change some code i get error messages down here uh their programmer cannot read properties so so for now this pro this code is basically made to to work in uh on the actual hardware and we haven't really set up a way to simulate it yet and the big question is whether we'll end up simulating it or whether we'll end up with an emulation or how we're going to do it is uh is for later for now i want to show you some other cool stuff i've made with uh with this let's see because i've only had this for for a little while uh i've not had a lot of time to play with it uh here's one called accelerometer filter which tries to play several things at the same time actually before i do that let me show you the drums of course why not uh because they're pretty easy to use uh let's just add a play sample bass drum with game one which is like on basically and then uh let's put a pause in after it of course uh let's pause for primary music again and download this and see what that sounds like oh turn the volume up sorry [Music] okay let's add some more drums let's add like some hi-hats play sample high hats and then um another pause then play example snare drum and then another hole and then play sample another hi-hat i guess and then that's it let's just do that oh i set the game to zero on all of these like that's why we can't hear the rest because they're all set to gain zero let's set against it not ten seconds one on them and then hopefully we have a beat i like i like it i don't know if you guys like it but i think it's uh it's great let's see what else we can do let's see if we can get some music going here uh so this basically all these purple things here are setting up the synthesizer voices and then and this one's going to be using two different synthesizer voices at the same time so two different sounds playing different things uh and then i've got this thing here that what is it it's doing this is like playing some notes and waiting and then playing oh yeah and then adding two to the note that is being played so it's kind of an algorithmic composition which is also uh something that i think is very interesting to teach people when they're doing programming how you can use algorithms to create art that creates itself basically um let's just see what this does oh yeah and over here we've got another forever loop that basically just gets the acceleration data and changes the parameters of the synthesizer every time it does that i wonder what that's going to sound like let's download this and look at [Music] there you go algorithmic house music all it took was i don't know uh 50 blocks of code but that's not all let's try something else uh because because this does work but uh after a while i don't know if it's done it yet no not yet after a while these different kind of sequences that you saw i'd set up will drift out of time with each other because of the way the timing in the microbit works so hello megan here's a uh there's another one where they're running background compass let's just try this i've just got a few more examples to show if i'm is this me getting kicked off kicked off megan you still have a few more minutes daniel please keep going downloading oh what oh yeah i have to calibrate the compass come on hello yes to phil the screen yes all right there we go this is uh there we go there there there we go all right now we should run oh yeah i remember this one uh so the way this one works is uh if i hold in the a button now and then i add the baseline [Music] if i hold in the b button then i have the chords on top and then i can change the filter of the chords by tilting up [Music] and then i can even press the logo here to check the drums the compass direction is modulating the whole music [Music] so that's an example of how you can control the synthesizer in real time while it's playing polyphonic sounds and multi-timbral meaning that it's playing different types of sounds at the same time on top of each other uh which is i think i think that's cool and then this last one here which is called jingle bells which is just one of those tedious experiments in what happens if i sit down and try to make jingle bells by chaining blocks after each other and it looks like this this is what jingle bells looks like as blocks there's a lot of them there could be more this isn't all of jingle bells this is just a little bit of pickleballs uh so let's download this to our oh wait you're not you didn't see that there's [Music] and then if i if i thought oh that's a cool sound but what happens if i uh change this oscillator to a square wave and uh instead of transposing it up by multiplying it by two what if i multiply it by four and then just download this again how does that change the music and i've made a completely different timber [Music] so [Music] there we go daniel i hate to interrupt but you have about a minute left um everyone is loving what you're doing i know someone in the chat was asking if you had some code or extension that you could share [Music] it's very much work in progress so it's on a it's on a it's hidden away on a github and uh i don't think we're gonna release it until we've like made it work a little bit more properly i mean as i was saying in the beginning it's like all the all the technically difficult stuff i mean this is a proof of concept basically really it's now we've proved that this you can do a synthesizer on a micro bit and get it to work with everything else so the next steps are setting it up in a sensible way because it's not set up in a sensible way at the moment that making a sound is is cumbersome well everyone will be waiting for that so thank you so much i think you've inspired a ton of people today um i know that everyone the keynote is rapping right now on the main stage if everyone wants to head there but thank you so much daniel that was so cool everyone was um in the chat dancing having fun so i really appreciate your time today yeah thanks thanks for having me have a have a nice day bye everyone
