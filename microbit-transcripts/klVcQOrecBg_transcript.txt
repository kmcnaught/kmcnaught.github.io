micro:bit LIVE 2021 | Bring back Classic Games with the micro:bit's Radio Feature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="klVcQOrecBg
okay well welcome everyone yep to our session and what we would like to do is just to kick it off in the chat could you just say hi john um tell us who you are where you're from but also what was your favorite kind of classic childhood game what did you like to play as a child and let's see what you have mousetrap okay pac-man that's a good one and then you'll also see there's links to our slideshow but the bitly link is on all of the slides in case you come in late or forgot and then we'll be participating battleship that's a good one [Music] so audra what's your favorite childhood game oh there are so many but um i used to feed uh the asteroids game and down the street from me with quarters all day long yeah yeah i did that with centipede that's my game um and even thinking even before those kind of arcade games what else would you play maybe out on on your neighborhood block um well kaboom was another favorite and if anybody remembers kaboom um and we had we had classic atari games my cousin did so i would play whenever i was at his house but i love pac-man um centipede i played a lot missile command there's so many yeah i know it's hard to choose so um if you want to go to the next slide not my bookmarks and to the next one so what we like to do is kind of focus in on our classic childhood games because we found that this is a great way to bring students in with something that they're pretty familiar with and kind of introduce coding to them in that way so that they could kind of build off of that experience and one other kind of unique thing about the micro bit so kind of transferring these games into the micro bit world but micro bit offers this radio feature and i feel like it's a little secret feature that once you introduce students to it they're going to love it because it allows them to interact with each other so thinking about how can you send messages from one micro bit to other micro bits and you're thinking of it as kind of a walkie-talkie system so setting up kind of your channel your radio group to kind of group the micro bits together and then using these special blocks that are on the screen so using the you know send block to send the message or a smile or a number and then also having the micro bits receive that message as well so thinking of it as you know those secret messages and i know somebody else in another session called it chuck a duck you could pass a duck back and forth so we're going to take advantage of that in this session as we learn how to introduce classic childhood gains we're going to focus on hot potato and then i think audra you're covering marco polo and then ann marie is going to close us out with the good old red light green light that people still play today so just to get a little bit more background on the radio feature audra can you click the link to the video and this video is really short and sweet but what i love it's from the microbits.org website and it's such a great way to introduce what it does you know to your students so we'll take a quick watch you can see it's only about a minute long so i've got my essay written and i've been working on it for about a week here we go radio is a way of transmitting and receiving messages over a distance the bbc micro bit can use radio waves to communicate wirelessly between micro bits in order to generate and detect these waves the micro bit has an antenna on top of the board you can program micro bits to use this radio feature while one device transmits or sends a message the other will receive the message and can be programmed to send a message back to help avoid interference from other micro bits also sending messages you can program your micro bits to belong to a group then they will only send and receive messages to each other in that group you can send messages to a friend or a group of friends design and build multiplayer games using the radio feature or even turn your micro bit into a pet tracking device so while today we're focusing on how to build that into classic games you can see that there's so many other you know applications of using the ability to talk back and forth between micro beds you may have noticed the small holes on the edge of your sorry about that that happens to me all the time so the next screen please and we want to frame it with this type of framework of use modify and create use mod create and using what's not yours and micro bit does such a nice job especially if you're a teacher who doesn't have much experience with coding or either your students use what's already available and play around with it get some experience with it make some changes some modifications to it and then you're able to kind of push them into that world of creating on their own and testing it out and analyzing it and fixing it and sharing that out next screen so we're going to keep that in mind but for me i'm diane horvath so like you heard on the technology makerspace kind of integration specialist at the middle school level here in massachusetts um i get to actually kind of test everything out in my sixth grade coding class i see them once a week over eight week period of time so i get to experiment a lot with them so what we're doing today is something that i'm going to show you some examples of what they did in the class but then i get to bring it into the other areas and i integrated across the curriculum as well so we'll apply stuff that we've learned in you know the foundations of cooking these types of games and apply it in maybe seventh grade english class or eighth grade science class and i just kind of find these little pockets of areas to work with people and push them to give students these kind of learning opportunities okay next slide so we'll start off with that classic hot potato game and when i introduce it to students i always want them to think about what do they know about the game already how do you play it so how many people do you need to play the game so you're looking for at least three or more what kind of objects are you using for that hot potato any other kind of tools so using that music so the game starts when you're playing the music people toss the potato to the next person it ends when the music stops and whoever has it is the person who loses the game and you keep playing so just kind of giving them that framework to work with there so that's our entry point and i always started off without that radio feature first just kind of having that thing now how can i translate this into using it with the micro bit so literally the micro bit becomes that hot potato and yes we do actually pass it around to each other in in the classroom so the other way that i also introduce things is using make code has such wonderful tutorials already set up so there's some students that could probably start the project on their own but then you think about those students who might need more support who don't have any coding experience and those are kind of the students that are coming to me in my sixth grade class they have little to probably no experience using anything so this helps them kind of work through and learn the tutorials check their own work then everybody has the same code that they're actually getting some practice you know downloading it directly onto the micro bit and then playing the game so we work through that and then we actually go into talking about how you can improve it after that so if you go ahead to the next slide i have a little video that shows this process of them playing the game and they had the best time so go ahead and we'll take a look at it and this is just the simulation of what the program was that they they were working with and so we have our skull and we'll talk about the code in a second [Music] so it gets them out of the receipts too they love to be you know active and they're learning it's spicy dylan died [Applause] for the championship okay here we go and she was the winner yeah so they got to experience that and they really you can tell they really enjoyed it but they did make some observations about what was working and what wasn't working so we came back to our tables and we sat down and we talked to the group like what did you see working well it was counting down but it was hard to see when it you know was over we didn't know exactly if it was still tight you know ticking sometimes the battery came out so they came up with putting rubber bands around the battery pack to the micro bit was the easy solution uh they figured out we wanted to go back and change in our code adding sounds so adding a sound when it was over so here on the screen you can see they said play a sad sound when it's done um and in this we also added actually a toggle light on and off so it kind of shows when it's ticking so the students would know that it was still kind of actually working and then i let's see what else and we added the button press so instead of shaking it we added a button press to be able to control when we started the game so those were ways that they just kind of quickest and modifications and then we went back and kind of tested it out again so from there we were able to kind of level up our skills and add the radio feature so if you can go to the next slide so now we wanted to talk about how can we code this game so that we actually toss the potato between each micro beds and that's where that radio feature comes in and i would show them that introductory video to explain how that radio feature works and some of those the blocks that we're going to use for that i mean we started off kind of in two parts so the first part was just doing the teleduct or chuck a duck lesson that you can find right on the microbit.org website and you're just pairing students up and they're using this you know they're grouping themselves in the same radio group then they're just going to create the code so that they're actually sending a duck to pass back and forth on the screen to each other and what we found out is that sometimes students we didn't have an even pair so we had a team of three and they were noticing some issues coming up as they were experiencing at that the duck could be on both of theirs at the same time or maybe they didn't know who was you know they're always shaking it to start it and it wasn't really being passed back and forth so we talked about some of those issues and what they could add to their code before then we moved on to doing it how could it work as a group so if we wanted everyone to join in as an entire class to pass that duck back and forth what could we do and so what's really helpful is if uh audra could you click on that telegroup tutorial the other thing that i really like about this and if you scroll down we were running out of time and i only get to see them for like once a week for 35 minutes so we talk about what it might look like but we go ahead and open up inmate code underneath the code there we go ahead and steal this code like we use it and we talk about what can we change and it's just two minor changes that we're making in this to make it work for our group so it's a small group of 10 students and we talk through what does this really look like once it loads on the screen so one is we really have to identify you know whose micro bed it should be sent to otherwise the way we had it set up before it was sending it to any one that was in that group at that time and so in this block here we talked about how many players do we need to change this to and then also we're studying our id numbers so each student had to figure out well how are we going to number these everybody gets their own number so that it can only send that signal to one micro bit at a time and it clears the screen after that and so it was really just making those two changes they all downloaded it back onto their micro bit and we went and we played the game again so if you go to the next slide and this is just a really short video of what that looks like so we checked to make sure everybody's id number shows up on their micro bit yep you can hear we added the sound effects so you knew if you got the duck and once in a while even it's a hyperspace but we got it to work and so they were very proud of what they were doing so that was the process that we work through and we kind of go through this with other classic childhood games but it's so it was so worthwhile because as a a team or a group they were able to collaborate and problem solve together did we want to do the jam board now audra or um let's we'll hold off we do have a jam board and we just ask you to think about as each of us present you maybe if you have ideas you um share them with us so the link is here in the presentation and um if one of you could throw that in the chat too that'd be great okay and before you start you know before you start we do have a birthday in the house a quick shout out it's sancho's birthday happy birthday um thanks for sharing too um so yeah i'm audrey kaplan i currently teach fifth and sixth grade middle school digital literacy computer science and we're really just getting started with the micro bits um i finally have um a set full class set in my classroom thanks to infosys pathfinders um john mulaney and um csta greater boston so um i don't really take my time out with that but like diane i try to um you know introduce what we're gonna do the kids make them think through um what we might need and i started with a really simple game called marco polo and um i don't really know that you win or lose you kind of end the game when you're done playing or you know whoever's it tries to find the other person and um if you don't know marco polo most of the time people close their eyes if you're in the pool you can't play outside blindfold someone and if you're marco you say marco they say polo in response and you use your ears to try to find them so we're in the beginning stages of using that with the micro bits um like diane had shared there's a little video here you could watch and a starter code also available on here but i'm going to kind of go through a little quickly because she gave you an overview of those and this is basically what we do and i'm also trying to get my kids to before we do any projects kind of think through the process we talked a little bit about radios and what that means and there's a great uh prompt and one of the uh lessons provided by make code where it asks the kids to first start thinking about how they could pass secret messages silently so together they table talk and come up with ideas they share them on the board and then we talk about how um getting you know they say things like um sign language walkie-talkies walkie-talkies aren't silent but these things come up in our discussions um charades writing notes notes on paper airplanes they come with all of these ideas and then i try to give them just kind of an overview of what the radio feature is i'm not expecting an expert with radio frequencies and such but we can certainly have a lot of fun with the micro bits so we talk about how one thing has to send a message and then another thing has to receive it and in our case it's the micro bit um and we get into a little talk about walkie-talkies and you know talk about how if you're hiking or on a ski mountain and your phones don't work people might use walkie-talkies and some of the kids are familiar with it and that gets us talking um about having the same channel like we're all on the same channel um which we use uh and micro bits um make code as group settings and diane already kind of talked about those already so we start out by identifying that we need to set a channel that we can all talk on and we work with the default here and which is set your group to one and then oh this is not marco polo so um this is supposed to say marco and this is supposed to say polo i apologize for that it might be on the next page um so after that we talk about needing to send character strings and we look i i often tell them to go fish in the micro bit drawers to see if they can figure out what they might need especially if it's a new set of blocks we're working with um and you know inevitably one or two kids figure it out i give them time to think about it they share it back and um we move on from there and i take their suggestions and we end up going with strings uh for this activity and uh the a button would normally say marco and the b button would say polo you're looking at an extension of what i did on this page so we talk a little bit about what the difference is with numbers and strings and i usually have them give me numbers like [Music] dollars or zip codes and dates and we talk about how one's a number and one's a string and what that means um and then we have to figure out a way for the micro bits to receive a message so again i tell them to go fish and ultimately we come up with this and one of the things i really like about the micro bit blocks is when you pull out this on radio received block and it says receive string you can actually click on this little rounds block right here and drag it into place on the show string so when we first do this it says show string hello in quotes which is the defaults so when we play it they all say hello and obviously that's not what we want so i go back to the board and i go back to the code and you know we work through it and talk about it and um they build this so then they get to actually test it on the simulator and i want to make sure emory has enough time so i'm going to go ahead a little quickly here but so here you see the radius string should say marco and polo um they test on the simulator the minute you click the a or the b button a second micro bit pops up on the screen and you could send the messages back and forth i do like to try using the simulator initially and then have them add the micro bits to test um mostly to save battery power and uh in the beginning just to get them comfortable with the program before i show them hack actually how to use the micro bits and this is a potential extension you could use and this is in the lesson if you uh which which is included in the previous slide an m and a p here you can see the m and the p so kids kind of know like diane had them looking for numbers so they knew that they were ready to go this kind of initializes and lets them know that they have the right program loaded um and they're ready to play and then you can add in playing sounds as well which really makes a lot of sense with marco polo because you're blindfolded and listening um so again this is another step you can add in uh i haven't done this with the audio yet but there's a way to hack the headphones so there's a little link in here if you want to check that out as well also by make code and uh i threw this in here we are also doing magic 8 but i'm going to skip over this this is another thing like diane had mentioned you could bring in the radio feature after they build this initially um so yeah uh the link to adding the sounds if you'd like to do that uh other extensions also on the make code page using morse code using like a 0 1 and 2 to represent no no dot no no code short code or long code i'm hot and cold similar to uh hot potato but actually it's not similar to hot potato only that it uses the radio feature but as you get closer to the beacon you would set one micro bit up as a beacon and one as the receivers the hunters rather and the kids would have the hunters with battery packs and they would try to find the beacon the hidden micro beat bit in the room um and then this was the extension that you just noticed um this next week is cs ed week as you are all probably well aware now that my kids have tried marco polo they're going to be working to um identify um a person of interest for cs ed week so if diane and i were partners and we were assigned channel 4 for example we wouldn't know we were partners yet um and i might have kimberly and she might have the name bryant which is the woman here in the middle and once we write our code and we figure out what channel we belong to i would send her my name and the word kimberly and then she would in response send me her name in the name bryant so i would then know who the person in class i was communicating with was and i would have identified the the name kimberly bryant and know that that is the person i'm going to make my csf poster for and i think that was it i want to give anne marie enough time so thanks for listening and see what's next hi everybody um i'm anne-marie wyman my camera for some reason is not working in hop-in today um it is working in my other applications that i tested so i'm not sure why but um i am here i'm a technology teacher i teach grades six seven and eight i typically use micro bits in the seventh grade and this year i decided to use it in the sixth grade for the radio game red light green light so audrey you could move to the next slide please so this kind of came up organically in my class and i find when it just kind of comes up the kids seem to be really excited and learn a lot so in sixth grade i teach scratch and a couple of my students they were working in a group so it was a pair of students made a scratch project on red light green light so after they showed their project to the class i said i i knew that there was one in the micro bits and i have a class set of micro bits i thought i would pull those out so the first thing that we did after we played they showed their scratch project was we went outside and played the game it was a beautiful day and most of the kids had heard of the game but not all of them so we went over the game we went outside and played it then we came back in and i told them next class we would play the game using these micro bits the little circuit boards and they were really really excited so the next thing we did was this was the next class period a couple days later that i wrote the program and passed it to them using the use modify and create that diane had talked about earlier and they had never programmed in make code before but they had a little experience in scratch and this is actually their first year programming in my district so they didn't have a lot of experience but what they were able to do was read the code and go through it and audra if you could go to the next slide please there's a lot of links in here so definitely click the links and keep the slideshow so i had them download the program we chose one person to be it and that was the person that really knew how to play the game and everyone else was a player so that in itself was a learning experience because my students have never downloaded to an external device so they had to plug it in um connect it download it so that was a nice experience for them to learn a lot and then once we worked through the bugs which there were we went outside again and played the game using the micro bits instead of just the people playing it so each student had a micro bit either a player or the it person um we played a few times and it wasn't perfect there were some things that needed to be changed so what we did was play a few times changed who was it people got to experience both positions and then we came back in and we sat down and we discussed what worked well what didn't what could you change and they had a lot of great ideas and a lot of ideas that they could um they all had the same ideas so what i did then was i had them edit the code to make it better and we decided as a class what we were going to edit but they edited it all in slightly different ways because they could make their micro bit you know show different pictures they wanted to add some sound and things like that so then we went out and played the modified game the modified game was a little better but they still found some um problems that could be worked out so we came back again and then they're reprogramming all the problems so first they used the program we kind of read it went through it then they modified it and i was surprised at how quickly that they picked up on this now because this is the second day that they're programming this that they've ever seen the micro bits or the mate code so they had some great ideas wherever were able to reprogram it and make it better um and if you could go to the next slide audra please because i know we're running out of time so this is just the code i'm not going to go through it this was the code that is on the tutorial the tutorial walks you through it it tells you how to play the real game with people it tells you how to play the micro bit version and um this was the code i passed to them and what you can do is you can share your project and publish it and i just put the link to the code in the google classroom for the students to access it they can now edit it once they have access to it so they could download it and they could edit it if you could go again audra so there were two that was the it and these are the players and the code on the bottom was the one that they had a lot of problem with so we had some really good discussions about how to improve it how to make it better and that had to do with the accelerometer which they had no experience with and now they know how to use it data how to program it so it was um really great experience um for them to be able to modify so on the third day this was a three-day project they modified some other things and kind of made their game perfect if you could go again audrey please um so there were some extensions that we also did this so in this link there is the actual tutorial from the make code site and then on the second day i actually broke the program before i passed it to them the second time i told them to you know take this new code and i had them debug it um change something minor just to see if they could read the code and think about it so they were able to do that um the other thing for the third day that we worked on is a how can we make this better how could we use what we learned with this radio feature and the radio waves to make another type of game and then how do you modify it to play in teams which would be as simple as picking different channels you know have a smaller game with um sections of the class and then the thing that we haven't finished yet but we are thinking of is the game over and the score they want to be able to score the game um so they're going to work out that code and program that the next time we meet um also there is the closest micro bit we did not program this yet but there's some information on that in that link with the packet signal strength a lot of interesting stuff um and i think there's one more slide you know we only have two minutes left uh oh after this one audra we'll see if we have time for the gym board um so just wanted you guys to be aware there's these are all links um the multi-ada domain code is nice you can have two screens up at the same time and you could be programming using the radio feature with both um you could be writing two programs so that's a nice thing the battery testers i've used and that's like the first level if your micro bit's not working first troubleshooting thing take your battery out let's see if your batteries work so having a battery tester made out of micro bits really nice useful way to use them and there are directions they are using at make code or microblocks um so there's a lot of information on that slide so i know we only have one minute left anyone having i think justin is like that end of our code program where the skull shows up or the ghost and it's awesome segway john maloney was teaching us all about being able to test some of the uh the batteries and the frequencies and circuits and ways to integrate the micro event as you work through some of your projects so i just want to thank you three for your passion commitment and sharing in terms of the projects you're up to and the different trajectories you are on with using the micro bit for the different programs that you're offering
