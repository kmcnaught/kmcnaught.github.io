micro:bit LIVE 2021 | TapeBlocks for micro:bits: Creative Circuit Making for All
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="LYS5CZJxzKo
uh so i'm here today to basically introduce you to take blocks um this project started i wanted to develop a circuit making activity that anyone could do and i tried and i failed several times as you do when you're making things uh but what i started to do was um if you have a look at this this is a tape block a tape block is basically it's a foam block has a double-sided conductive tape and components are pushed in on top or stuck underneath okay and it means that people with cerebral palsy can actually push them together with the back of their hands which i thought was pretty exciting because it opens up circuit making to a whole lot of people now stay with me for relevance to micro bit okay stay with me i promise i will get there okay goes both directions um so you can't even get it wrong okay so by color the leds solve that i also work with blind people so we can use vibration motors okay and because you can fans okay they're all just hooked straight into a three volt so where we get to with the micro bit is um because the micro bit uh you can program uh of course have you ever noticed that usbs always have three sides you know this way this way this way yeah um okay with the micro bit what i'm gonna do franklin's gonna help me for two seconds is franklin franklin's a mirror and franklin helps me do electronic stuff okay so with the tape lock all i've done is connected it to banana plugs uh connected it to banana plugs and that then becomes um here and you can turn it on and off with a and b you've got to love it when live demos actually work so you can so this is just a like turn it on with button a turn it off with button b that's it so it means that anything you can program onto a micro bit you can actually push out into physical programming by just connecting the banana plugs and the tape and then which is great and so i've got another example here here three sides again on the okay so this one here is very messy but what i've done is basically set it up as a set of traffic lights so but what it does is i mean this is just a really really great way of introducing people who are a bit worried about um you know or new to it to physical programming so that and it's really fun and enjoyable so people can do things that are actually of interest to them and um basically you can um there's lots and lots of different things that you can do with them uh there's tutorials available at a website tapeblock.com so there's lots and lots of tutorials available there so you can see what happens because then you can do other stuff with them i've got to show you this one which is if we start saying that this is circuit making and this is stem you're going to appeal to a whole different group of people to what you normally appeal to so if you if you make these really creative things so if you make these really creative things then you're going to appeal to a different bunch of people okay so i work in disability trains are really big in disability so all of a sudden it becomes relevant for people as well and then you can connect them to the micro bit you can either sit them on top or underneath et cetera lots of exciting things to do so they're take blocks have a look at tapelock.com for tutorials and is that nearly time one more minute okay uh that's it that's all i prepared um the banana plug here's what i prepared earlier okay banana plug banana plugs are can be better than alligator clips because they don't slip off once you put them in they're firmly in in terms of actually preparing them um you just cut and strip the wire and then to make one you grab a block best thing to do is actually put tape underneath okay there we go uh so when you're making them if you put tape underneath go all the way around and over the top then it becomes a sandwich if you don't go underneath then you can find that it pushes into the foam and won't make such a good connection so i call them like you know they're circuit sandwiches okay um based on this stuff you can just do the most amazing amount of stuff it's just really awesome so have a try have a go okay i don't use copper tape i use um this is a nylon [Music] copper nickel fabric tape because it's really really flexible and you'll notice that what i'm doing is cutting the silver don't cut the white if you cut the white then you have to start it again and starting it is really really really hard or if you cut the tape the silver uh it just comes off like that that's how easy it is to open it thanks kristen an amazing presentation love the the invitation for all to be successful and and the uh artistic approach um for any if you can put your contact information in the chat and respond to any questions that was amazing
