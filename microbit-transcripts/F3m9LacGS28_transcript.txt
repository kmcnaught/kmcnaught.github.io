okay can everyone see my screen right now yeah working good okay all right so uh thank you please i'm so happy to be here tonight with a truly amazing person with michelle with eating i'm so happy to see everyone in the chat so i'll go with my presentation so as today i'm going to share about integrating microbead in primary science teaching and learning so basically i'm teaching in an elementary school and i'm teaching science as uh eating mentioned just now in malaysia we have basic programming elements or topics that are being taught in design technology especially in primary 4 and primary 6 to primary 6 sorry okay so this is a the main subject which is designed to energy which uh implement or integrating basic programming however there are no uh specific subject that combine or use uh programming in other way so this is uh the book okay this is how they use the material and it's actually new for me as michelle mentioned i'm not a programming or expert in in computer science and i try to adapt or try to integrate uh design technology with science and by using micro micro bit [Music] and why i want to integrate microwave into science teaching and learning because it helps the students to explore and expand their knowledge and also skills especially in uh micro uh computational thinking and also by doing so they will have fun so how i integrate microbead microbial environmental science basically i integrate in two ways first is through directly and also indirectly so how i use it directly i use it by mapping it with specific topic in the curriculum itself okay as far as time this is an example primary five signs this is how i try to map it but for example for human topic i try to make a project a simple project by building a movement counter and as for animal uh topic i try to help or encourage students to build a cat feeder so this is how i met this topic with the activities itself and as for seven second one is project based which is the most popular uh method that's being used by teachers all around the world to integrate microbead in their lesson so by doing project-based we can combine several topics in one single project and we encourage students to share or introduce solutions or improvement towards a problem okay usually people will for project-based people or teachers will introduce uh the students to solve a problem by uh searching for the right track or improve the pro uh improve something based on their problem and directly to the solution but as for me i try to use backward method project based learning which i give them outcome that i want them to achieve and ask them to plan and solve it so i'm using a different kind of project based learning and [Music] in a backward method i encourage students to think and explore ideas and possibilities to achieve the account instead of them uh searching for the problems and uh try to do it in a normal way so this is way i try to uh i mean i introduced the project to them i ask them to i give a situation and i ask them to find or plan the project sorry too fast and i ask them to propose a pitch their idea presentation and at the same time i teach them to code okay problem is science education in nature we don't have we have limited time so what we do is i use i ask the students to join my session outside the school uh timetable i mean when their free time they can't come to the lab and learn the code so to complete their projects and after that they i'll teach them or i assist them in the project development and after that they will present their project so this is the project made by students which uh actually won third place in a competition for the innovation project so when he uh what she does is uh smart city which uh using microbead as the core uh micro processor rhian yes sorry i'm so sorry to interrupt we're just uh we're starting to cut into the next session time okay uh so uh best project will be given opportunity to empty for group micro b competition representing schools and this is one of those uh two students which managed to go to the national level to present their approach innovation project and they won a second price uh for the project itself uh for me the most important thing is giving opportunity for students to explore and have fun at the same time and the most important thing don't limit their imagination because from there they will learn more and more and try to expand their knowledge and skills i think that's all from me thank you
