hello everybody welcome back to this the final session of microbit live 2021 we've got several hours of exciting presentations sessions um insight left for you of this outstanding conference if you haven't already i'd love to encourage you to check out the expo section on the platform there's a load of interesting stuff going on there as well and remember if you've missed any sessions if you're looking at the schedule and you see something yesterday you're interested in you can go back and rewatch all of the stuff and and the sessions will be available after as well so we've got a really exciting set of things but before that i want to just focus a little bit more um before this afternoon session on the microbit foundation's mission which gareth talked about yesterday to inspire every child to create their best digital future and i think lots has been talked about in uh over the course of the last two days how we're doing this and i want to look a little bit about how authentic problems and setting challenges that students can really engage with can help us achieve this mission so one of the things that became quite clear early on in the microbit project was that one of the ways physical computing could be so effective was by allowing students to engage with the things they really cared about and not learn to code or gain digital mastery as the side effect that sorry as the primary thing we're going to do they're not they don't sit down you're going to learn coding today what they do is they learn digital mastery as a side effect of doing something they really care about or engaging with a problem that inspires them and i think that point of technology being the tool and and the learning coming as a result of the enthusiasm about the problem it's been a really powerful way that uh microbit's been able to be effective and one of the things we've learned through the work we've done is that if you can set authentic problems to students and make sure they have accessible and effective technology and actually then throw in a bit of the fact that students often they don't know what should be impossible they're not conditioned to think oh i can't do that no it's too big a problem then you can get absolutely incredible solutions by setting up these ideas and really inspiring and i think also we find that where the problems are authentic we can really broaden the engagement and the range of people that want to engage so one way that we've seen this is by thinking of the global goals as the authentic problems to present so you say can how can microbit help tackle some of the biggest problems facing humanity and we've actually not just taken this you know as a side thing we've made it a key part of what we do at microbit with the do your bit challenge which if you haven't heard of do your bit it's a challenge that brings together bbc microbit and the global goals to challenge children to solve problems with technology and um we're running it again next year and the we're going to be looking at these are item three also goal three 10 13 14 and 15. so they do your bit we ran it um in 2021 we had thousands of students around the world uh the world enter and 50 countries involved in the in the challenge and if you haven't checked out the winners of do your bit uh for 2021 then you can find them all here so here are just some of some that we've picked up that i think are absolutely incredible we've got this is a project to pull birds nests out of rising waters these students looked at the monitoring forests and kind of deforestation i love this group they identified that asthma was um kind of worse in different temperature times so they were using the microbe to monitor temperature and giving people warnings about asthma this project was about physical activity and kind of reducing access to technology if you hadn't done your level of physical activity and this was about kind of monitoring health and activity as well so one of the things i think is really interesting for us to think about for the long term is we've already got microbit tackling some of these global goals and we've got students thinking about how they can invent with the microbit to tackle some of them we're asking how many more can we tackle in fact is it possible if we get the right technology and the right partners involved in this mix can we have technology like the microbit students tackling all of the global goals by thinking about what they can do with technology and the micro bit so that brings us on to this afternoon so i'm really delighted to be able to introduce kate maloney who is the executive director of the emphasis foundation usa um emphasis are one of the emphasis usa or one of the partners that the the microbit foundation has spent years really working alongside and in partnership with and in the last six months we've been working on a very particular collaboration that you'll be able to find out a lot more about uh next uh next week so kate is the executive director of infantry's foundation usa which is the philanthropic arm of synthesis limited i think it's going to become clear as you uh see that there's a huge ck to talk there's a huge alignment between the goals of the microbial educational foundation and the infothis foundation usa uh and so i'm really excited about the things that we're going to be able to do together and the things we're going to talk about so kate thank you very much over to you thanks johnny uh good morning to everyone it is such a pleasure to be with all of you at this great event uh as mentioned my name is kate maloney and i have the good fortune of leading the infosys foundation usa mission is to increase access to k-12 computer science and maker education for educators and students and we take a particular focus on those communities that are both under resource and under-represented we believe that all k-12 students must have the opportunity to create the solutions technologies and products that address important challenges to make their communities and the world a better place so to achieve this we know we all need to work jointly to help them develop the 21st century skills that will allow them to thrive in what is increasingly a digital economy so i think we know by all being here today computer science is essential but we also must recognize that access to computer science is not universally accessible so our foundation is working hard to also support that very lane where maker education and computer science intersect for those of you who may be a little bit less familiar uh maker education provides multiple pathways for students to engage in more of a hands-on computer science so this becomes very personally meaningful we hope culturally relevant and most importantly inclusive so while i acknowledge our foundations working in the us i know i'm speaking to a global audience and i know that there's the same energy and conviction and recognition that we need to spark the imagination of children all over the world to create social impact in their communities no surprise innovation and inclusivity are clearly at the heart of the microbit educational foundation's work so that's why we love them as a partner and they've been one as johnny mentioned for a number of years um one of our if i can make a small plug one of our signature programs is something called the pathfinders institute and some of you tuned in this morning may have joined us um and some of you i hope in the future do come this has been an in-person training or professional development for k-12 educators and really i just mention it because it speaks to our commitment to invest in all of you the digital teachers of the future microbit's been right alongside us since the beginning at those in-person trainings and also very recently have spent um a very diligent six months or so developing content for our online version the pathfinders online institute by the same name this platform exists now free to everyone and has a number of live and asynchronous opportunities for educators to work on their own professional development but also engage with your students in exciting ways in the us next week is computer science education week cs is everywhere and we have a very exciting announcement and launch that will take place on monday so i don't want to give too many hints but i do encourage you to follow the foundation and of course microbit uh on social media to take advantage of that exciting opportunity in addition to our pathfinders institute which is all about educating and professional development for you the educators we also have something called the infee maker awards uh and my remarks are not just to plug what it is that we're doing as a foundation but more to speak about the important programs that we need to support for youth around the world the infee maker awards uh are recognizing that some of the magic of computer science and making takes place in the classroom but also in museums and libraries and after-school programs where we're really working to enable and unlock that agency and creativity of our youth to tackle really big problems even at a local level with technology-enabled solutions in 2021 it wouldn't surprise you all to hear that we focused the awards on innovations that brought maker ed remotely or at home and i'm excited to share that one of our awardees this past year was a maker space called gizmo cda this is in idaho and the reason i'm mentioning them is because they put the micro bit to use so i want to take a minute and show their application video with you i think you'll see firsthand more than my own words those of an 11 year old named molly um and before we press play i just want to preface there is a slightly unique voice at the beginning of the video please keep an open mind this was the creative application that gizmo put forward but i think at the end you'll see how important it is to bring computer science to life and how our youth are ready to take and run with these concepts over to our video as one of the founders of gizmo it was my job to sit with kids who just needed a little space i was the cleaning crew for the late-night dinners of the robotics team i did everything there have been changes but never like the ones caused by kovid now i deliver gizmo to go kids for kids at home because it's not safe for them to come in when we talked about a year-long remote coding class i volunteered to teach sadly even with drag and drop my paws were too big for the keyboard molly was one of our gismologists and she offered to be the video mentor and you know what she does a better job hi my name is molly today we're going to be talking about micro bit this is the first video so i'm just going to go over a couple basic things so we'll start with the parts of the micro bit let's start with the front as you can see this little block right here those are all the leds um over here right here and right here these are the buttons that you can program to do things like when you push this button it'll show picture on the leds and then they get a pdf that's filled with information do you know what i think i'll do the class with them thank you all for taking a minute to observe molly i think you can see why molly and gizmo cda was one of our 2021 winners uh she is clearly impressive i think perhaps even to the microbit foundation you may even have a future or current ambassador um but my real message in sharing that is that i really hope all of you feel even more convicted about the need to start teaching computer science young it is never too early now if you like allow me please to conclude with an encouraging invitation and this is building upon uh johnny's great remarks at the beginning of this session and that was to consider amazing ways we can use computer science and maker education concepts to help kids create solutions to big challenges since i'm speaking to a global audience which i love this is a wonderful chance to remind us again that we are officially in the decade of action that means the clock is ticking toward the deadline that's been set for the achievement of the un sustainable development goals as microbit and johnny were mentioning there are a number of them that they have selected but all of you know there are 17 goals to choose from 2030 is the year that all of us around the world will be held to account for achieving milestones in education in health and as we all know very well having just witnessed cop26 climate climate being a very passionate subject for our youth so i want to encourage all educators who are watching to really dig into this do your bit challenge i have yet to have a chance to use it with the foundation or our partners but um the micro bit foundation colleagues i work closely with know how much i love this as a personal note before leading the foundation i was completely immersed in all things sdgs so i am particularly passionate about the power to use and unlock the creativity of our youth to help us get there so all educators the resources are there for you to introduce this framework to help you bring these concepts to life and get your students engaged so speaking of big questions and local solutions i i wouldn't be surprised if we're going to see molly in a very official role someday soon but i know those of you who are joining us from multiple countries you know mollies you know the likes of children who have the same aspirations if only they are exposed to these concepts so the time is now there is no need to wait to bring this exposure to our youth i want to thank you for listening today and a special thank you to the microbit educational foundation for inviting me to be with all of you uh i'm going to steal some of their very own words that i love let's get coding and let's change the world together thank you
