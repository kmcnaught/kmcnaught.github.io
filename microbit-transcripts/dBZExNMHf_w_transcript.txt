thank you so welcome everyone uh you know in person and and maybe watching this a little bit later uh i'm adam maltese and i'm a faculty member at uh indiana university and i'm joined today by barbara and nikima and i'll let them say a quick intro for themselves hi i'm nikki malenzi i'm currently a production consultant with the microbit educational foundation and i'm really excited to be here today and hi i'm barbara i'm from mexico i'm a designer and educator and currently teach at the university over here thanks to both of you i realize that i can't my uh my shirt is sort of hidden uh by the camera unfortunately but i'm representing as best i can um so just to you know i know we don't have a lot of time today and this is unfortunately going to be a little bit more of a of an info dump than it is going to be an interactive session but um we can do plenty of plenty of interactivity at other times if you want i want to give you a little bit of background of where this idea got started and then the different iterations we've gone through and so um we started to go back a minute uh this co-build 19 that we started uh is a project that we got funded through both the infosys foundation usa and then the national science foundation and uh the idea was to to create uh projects and activities for families while they were home during the pandemic uh using you know low cost or no cost things that they have around and accessible and so uh we share a link to that later in the in the presentation um but there's a lot of activities on there and one of the things that we wanted to do as part of that we didn't do it at the beginning because uh we didn't we we didn't think about using the microbit simulator as the way to connect with families instead of the the device um so so a lot of what's on there are you know activities where they're making and building with their hands so physical physical things um as that started to not wind down because of course the pandemic is still going on but as we shifted from this first push out of a lot of activities and on that website there should be about 60 different activities and videos and things for for you to explore we started thinking of other opportunities for us to uh other ways for us to engage kids and families and so uh we love the microbit we've used it frequently in professional developments that we've run with teachers we use it in events with kids and so we were trying to think how can we incorporate this and so what we did was we came up with an idea for this club and the idea for the club is uh that we um we wanted to create something where we could engage kids and families around coding but that we would take a different approach none of us are coders by training uh or computer science educators by training and so we often think of the micro bit or arduinos or raspberry pi's as as tools to allow us to get done you know different tasks yes it's fun to learn how they work but really it's usually being incorporated into other tasks to run a servo or to be a sensor of some sort and so um what we really wanted to do was drive with this idea of how can we use the idea of design to drive the need to learn coding rather than maybe a more common approach which is to just learn coding because you're interested in it um this comes out of my research which is partly due on how we partly related to how we get people interested in stem with computer science being part of that and um and thinking about things like how do we get more uh women interested in these areas and knowing that women generally speaking have more interest in in problem solving uh rather than just the pure you know uh interest in coding for its own sake so we wanted to enter with that as an approach uh we had the thought that you know we can do a lot of this on the simulator the especially the um make code simulator stimulator is fantastic so we can do a lot of this on the simulator and what we did was set up a situation where if kids participated for a certain amount of time uh you know across the weeks then we would send them uh a physical device so that they could use that while they're coding and so that was uh that was part of the idea uh of course we'll talk a little bit later about uh you know shortages uh for the actual devices and uh microbit version two coming out in the middle of the club and all that sort of stuff that led to fun but um that's that's sort of the background and what did i what i want to do now is walk you through some of the different iterations of the code of the clubs that we've run so the first club that we ran uh was barbara and i and two colleagues casey shea and joel bruns who are not here today but uh again we sort of entered with this idea we ran it across six different weeks we had advertised this on facebook um and had um i think over two uh nearly 200 families expressed interest in this uh there was an issue where we were you know it's hard to to set up an event across um different time zones uh you know this one is a good example of how to do it well uh we were doing it on a week night and so that was sort of challenging because you know uh on the east coast we'd run up against bedtime uh if we pushed it later we had it earlier uh like late afternoon and the problem there was kids on the west coast were still in school so we'll talk about some of those challenges later but we ran it online the idea was it would be weekly sessions on zoom for an hour uh we would get together do some activities keep it you know keep it moving keep it exciting um and try to do both activities and some time in make code uh so that they could work through some of the simulator and some coding projects and then we'd sort of give them a challenge or a task that they would do before the following week uh and we hosted that part really on flipgrid um and and again i know um naikima and barbara will talk about that a little bit more for how they ran that with the girls design with code club next so just briefly um the the setup was we started with really just you know turning on lights and sounds uh we tried to tie many of the challenges in this partly based on the research funding tried to tie many of the challenges in this to a covid and so the first thing we had them create as a challenge after we gave them a little bit of an introduction was a hand washing timer so how to use the micro bit to create a hand washing timer then we talked about uh doing some sensing of the environment so using the temperature the tilt the light sensors uh and how you could use that to set up uh you know if you're baking a lot during the pandemic and you're making cookies and somebody's trying to steal your cookies how you could use the microbit to try to you know to try to create a security system for that the next one was introducing variables in logic and we had servos in there and that one was i think uh you know a lot of us have pets and we want to give those pets a treat or we want to sort of create something for them so can you use a servo to create sort of a pet you know food dispenser or treat dispenser then we talked about during the pandemic we have to keep distance uh the micro bits are great we can we can simulate the sending of radio messages uh so let's you know we could communicate over a distance uh we actually figured out a way to use radio to to create a distance sensor but we thought that that was a little bit too advanced for the kids so we kept it at a more typical um you know radio sending a radio message sending a message over a distance uh and we started more and more shifting a little bit toward focusing on the design aspects they were incorporated throughout but um for the final challenge we gave them the chance to create their own thing whatever they wanted to do what problem they wanted to solve so i would say from weeks four on we really embedded a little bit more about design and empathy and then in weeks five and six we really just left the time open we introduced them to some ideas but it was less about technical ideas more about design and how you might um use the design process and then use the micro bit to solve some of the problems that that you might have so just to walk you through a little bit of you know some images for this quickly before i hand it off um in the first session we had over 100 people join uh that created its own interesting challenges like this is just one of the screens that we had users on but it was really awesome to see so many kids kids with their parents or caregivers and other educators who are interested in using this uh we did one of the first things we did was an algorithm design game where we gave some rules and then the kids had to hold up different colors as we held up a certain color uh to the screen they had to hold up certain colors of objects following a set of rules based on the type of peanut butter they liked and so you know we tried to use games like that to introduce some of these computational thinking ideas and more uh you know more basic computer science ideas this is sort of what our slides looked like where it got a little bit more technical um so when we got into some environmental sensors you know we tried to give them some information definitely didn't want to get too deep into this our target age range was was in the range of uh you know sort of middle school in the us so i'd say probably in the range of 10 to 14 uh was our target we definitely had some younger we definitely had some older but we tried to sort of introduce these and again less focus on the technical pieces and more on how you might code with this and how you might use this to solve problems uh this is just another picture of when we were in make code you know we'd have the sort of picture and picture of one of us instructing um and then we would share screen so we could actually walk them through some of the you know the ways that they might code for these and again we tried to keep it really simple and gave them a good amount of time in each session to um to play with the idea so we'd sort of give them a quick intro on how we might do it and then we'd give them 5 or 10 minutes to do that and then we'd come back together see if somebody wants to share you know and then we'd add sort of another layer of difficulty or challenge into the mix um this is a little bit later in those sessions where we started getting more into designing for other people so we gave them some scenarios this one happens to be uh about you know designing for somebody who has these interests but also happens to be blind um and thinking about how you know empathy and designing for others with with them in mind uh is important especially when you're trying to create solutions for them um i will just show this quickly here um let's see if it goes that it does not so let me just change quickly because i think some of you might be interested in this yeah so one of the things that we created uh in the way of a game and i know this is a little bit tiny um but we created a set of spinners with uh we use these pretty frequently when we're talking about design so we have a challenge that and these are this is meant to be gamifying design uh and and actually getting over the issue of sort of silliness in problems so we've got a set of uh of options on here what just came up when i spun it was uh the challenge is a way to become famous the user the main user we're designing for is an auto mechanic and they have to use the micro bit function of you know they have to incorporate logic in some way and so you know we use these a couple times really as sort of ice breakers and activities just to get them thinking about this one as a way to show gratitude for a witch using the radio function some of these are more logical than others but the idea was just to sort of break the ice uh and and this has worked really well in terms of getting people to think about how some of those functions can be used and again designing for for other people there all right so let me go back to the slides and i'm going to pass it over to nychema and barbara and they will talk to you about one of the the second iteration of the design with code club hello everyone so for the next part this um the previous version was on october november 2020 at the end of the year and then after it was done and we saw what were the potential changes and things that were well things that didn't we thought okay why don't we focus or create a version in a more uh limited way for a certain kind of people and then we notice how let's create a girl's version of it and and we started thinking oh how could how the same structure and the same base that we design can apply and be meaningful for girls so they age range was changed to 10 to 10 13 years old which is uh when girls get more interested in stem or coding or science so it was a great opportunity to highlight these topics and we thought in opening for all girls around the world we wanted to see how how this could work in uh if we were online we were still like very long at home and how will this look like for opening and accessibility so we started contacting uh people that we know in other countries and friends and just social media like very organic not that much planned and we were very surprised that we got over 17 countries and 17 different u.s states around the world of girls that were interested in joining the the program uh at the end it was the same structure if they qualify for and did the activities they will receive a microwave with that was a complete challenge because the shipping shipping international is it's a complete different topic yes it was a a good learning experience but but well besides that um we started thinking okay it it's not just girls that speak english we will have different languages different cultures how can we use that to create and to form our our content so all the content while we were exploring the basic concepts of content of coding and we use the main code and the micro bit and we were using different design challenges but we also wanted to highlight the role of women in computing sciences and as we had this super bar um diverse group of girls how can we bring their experience and their knowledge and their quarters into the into the classes or the sessions so uh this was how the sessions with the girls look like it was a very nice and open environment they love to share they love to help each other which was a big change from the previous camp they were like so much secure and open to talking to share with each other and to ask questions uh next adam please so for for the logistics and the operation we had six uh sessions over six weeks once a week but during the week the girls had to work on different challenges that were building on the content that we were talking about like the basic content of coding but connected to their personal experience and different topics so uh we use a flippery platform uh for uh for them to share their projects comment on each other projects and get feedback and ask questions and well we can play like a few seconds for you to look like how it looks like hi i'm rebecca and this is my week 4 game challenge for this week i've created a exercise game so when on start it'll set random number to pick a random number between 1 and 40. when you click button a and b it'll choose a random number and this one just doesn't it i'll use this one just as an example if the random number is less than 5 then it will do this now each each different exercise has a melody thank you adam uh well so that's how it look like sometimes they include their picture sometimes they include an animation but it's a great way to use fleet grid to share and and to learn of each other's coding because they all had the same challenge but knowing different paths and different ways that you can get to a result was very interesting and then they also commented on each other which was great for community building hi i'm rebecca and this is my week 4 game challenge and then we also include on the live sessions each week on blog activities because the live the live sessions were not just about teaching them like the basic concepts and then uh asking for their challenge but we we try to do ice breakers or unplug activities uh based on the concept of coding when they get to share and interact and play which also was a lot of fun so they get the the idea of the concepts in an unplugged way that you don't have to have technology to learn and to understand and then we jump to the more technical part of it through may code and the challenges and i will pass it on to naikima for the second section hi everyone um so to reiterate what barbara said uh we really wanted to make sure that our girls had a strong foundation in the fundamentals of coding concepts so as barbara mentioned each week we built on coding concepts so as you saw in the previous slide we started with the basics of like variables and what type of data types that you can store in variables and worked up to if and else statements and different iterations such as for and while loops so one of the ways that we continue to try to build community and make this a fun interactive um program for our girls is we came up with a creative contest and so we challenged the girls to look up some female pioneers in computer science data science cyber security and basically recreate um an image of one of these pioneers in computer science and so you can see on this slide that we had um students um choose katherine johnson um sophie h uh heidi lamar and margaret hamilton and the girls really had a great time doing this i think for them they were able to see um representation to see women who paved the way for computer science and made very big strides in the industry and it inspired a lot of them to want to be pioneers you know in their own communities and schools next slide so one of the final challenges that we did with our girls which was near and dear to my heart was focused on accessibility we challenged the girls to design a wearable or assistive device to improve slash help an individual or marginalized group in their community we used a tool that barbara actually recommended which was cards for humanity if you guys aren't sure what that is i definitely recommend you checking it out it gives you different prompts so similar to what adam showed in his slides you might have an individual who really enjoys going to concerts but is hard of hearing so how can they um enjoy concerts if they're hard of hearing or deaf and it really allows your students to have a lot of open conversations about how we make the world more accessible to individuals with disabilities so um we had the students code their project and then they drew up designs for a physical prototype because as barbara mentioned they had to complete so many challenges to actually receive a physical microbit so for a lot of them we just got drawings of what their devices would ultimately look like but it was a great time i really think when we allowed the girls the opportunity to design for their communities a lot of them brought in things that were culturally specific to them so some students talked about how they live in communities of food deserts or how in their culture their grandparents live with them so they need assistive technology for their elderly family members some of them talked about how they have family members who have autism spectrum disorder i was just really shocked to see how these girls really found connections within their own personal lives next slide we don't have time to show this whole video um but here is one of my favorite challenges that a student named fifi submitted she wanted to focus on individuals with um speech impediments um who may or may not lack confidence when speaking to people um on the phone or in person and kind of help them find their voice adam can you play the video for a little bit hey everyone so [Music] for my week five code accessibility um i did something for people who um you know have who are not very confident and and maybe have trouble speaking um in a conversation or speaking on the phone um so it so um how's your okay so here she put in different lines of strings of code so that people could ask how are you um for her project this obviously worked better if you were in person but she did come to us after the challenge and asked if there was a way that someone could pre-record um these questions and actually have the micro bit physically play these sounds if um a speaker was attached next slide all right i'ma let adam take back over yeah thank you and of course we would love to spend more time talking about all these things and sharing all the examples um what we uh what we're doing right now is uh i'm working with an educator uh at the rocky mountain deaf school and uh we are taking some of the the first you know v1 uh design with code um and modifying it for work with his students and he's running this sort of through an after school club so it's a little bit different format um shorter periods and his school's uh his students are deaf and usually uh deaf students have other you know comorbidity with other accessibility challenges as well so you can see here i won't i won't speak through all this um you can see here the outline it's it's pretty similar to what we did at first i think the interesting piece is uh you know when we started going through this he said look you know i think what what's obvious is like from the start we should we should cut out anything with the sounds because that's just not applicable for my students and so i said okay that makes sense you know and you're the expert uh educator on this i my background is not an accessibility and so um he started doing it the first week and let them the first challenge that we do is like sort of an intro to just generally the idea of what we're going to do a little bit of an intro to the scavenger hunt where they go through the make code interface and they have to find different blocks and um and what he found is they started playing with things right away and he said guess what their favorite activity is it's making music and sound so he said scratch my idea from before let's put all the sound stuff back in uh in the planning and so you know what we're doing is we're we're playing with this and seeing really what what his students are interested in um you know where where we can modify things to fit their interests and to fit um you know to try to make it as accessible as possible so um i'm not going to play any video of this but you know i showed you an example of sort of what it was before really the main modification is where we're cutting things and chunking them slightly differently and then um david who you see here down in the lower corner i'm sure he would really appreciate me capturing this image of him but he is going through and doing the asl interpretation of all the videos uh and so we have his image up there at all times now one of the interesting challenges there is um there are not interpreted signs for a lot of the coding topics and techniques that we would commonly use so he's had to sort of create some of these um and we've had questions or thoughts about you know how do you standardize some of these so that they're sort of used repeatedly both in this session and then even across sessions um this is the the challenge that we're gonna do in his group as the final challenge so we're tying in uh the sustainable development goals uh and this is just an image of sort of what that final challenge will look like for his group uh and he's very excited about this and his students are i think they're more excited than he thought they would be so he wants to try to figure out how they can they can do this um i know in our last moments here uh i've got one more slide after this which is challenges but what we're hoping to do and and i know uh i'll say i didn't catch up with barbara but uh already made a couple connections um through microbit live before of potential uh educators who can help us with this um we'd love to run another girl's design with code but we were thinking a a version that's uh fully in spanish um and we were thinking probably in north and south america but you know heck we can maybe consider opening it more broadly and we're going to try to change up the format a little bit where it would be probably across three weeks rather than six and maybe meet twice a week we're thinking about you know maybe running clubs for um for teachers uh for parents only um you know for very capable dogs for whomever really thinking about where we can modify this and then we've had some folks get in touch with us about the you know well what's next so you got me interested we got started how do we up the game and jump into um you know doing diving deeper and again a number of the sessions in this in microbit life have sort of been about that jumping to that next step so trying to think about where we can go with that um and then i'll just quickly speed through the challenges here um the you know some of the things that we ran into is uh or our recruitment so how do we get people right there's a lot of coding challenges out there uh or coding camps and those sorts of things how do we you know how do we get people to come to ours uh so i'm not sure that we solved anything there but that was one of the challenges uh you've probably all been facing zoom fatigue at this point uh in the pandemic and so how do we get you know we had a number of parents say look really interested in this the kids are interested but i just i don't want them on one more hour of device um so maybe it's a little bit now better as a lot of folks have gone back to school but that was still an issue breaking all of this interesting computer science content down into into sizable chunks that are consumable by kids and novices uh but not make it so boring um you know we definitely had uh like i said we had a large group of over 100 people join the first session there was a huge range of of experiences um there and so thinking about differentiation and how you make everyone advance right uh not make it so boring for the advanced people and not make it too much above the heads of the novices um and then also you know just a logistical thing of um let's say i was running a session on turning on lights there would be kids jumping on and saying like i can't see anything or you know my simulator's not loading on my whatever device or you know whatever and so like having a team of people allowed for us to to separate out where some people could put out the fires while other people were still keeping the main show you know going on it's sort of like like broadway um how do we capture participation that was our main research focus so thinking about we used flipgrid pretty well but really how do we capture participation both while they're with us and while they're home and you know how they're solving their own problems um i already mentioned the sort of multiple skill levels it barbara mentioned shipping micro bits we spent way more money and way more time trying to find vendors and ways to ship you know small electronics to different places including rwanda and remote regions of central america where you tell them like approximately where these people live by like 600 meters that way and 200 meters that way in costa rica um so that was a huge challenge and then just finding instructors uh you know i know there are a lot of folks out there and again we're we're preaching to the choir here but um if you're interested in ever working with us on this uh you know please let us know uh we'd love to to join forces and and do more there and um the slides are available so um you can get in touch with us in a number of different ways but i appreciate you all uh joining us and and hearing what we had to say and i really appreciate the contributions of barbara and nikima in um you know in running some different versions of this that i think was really really successful well thanks adam and barbara and nakima i i have to say that i really enjoyed um you know tagging design with real people in mind like it makes it so much more meaningful when you have a real person that you're trying to make your design work for like that makes it very authentic and um just before i let you go adam julie wanted to see the micro bit final challenge slide again i have a feeling there might be a screenshot in the offing but anyway she'd like to have a picture of that and for everyone else i encourage you to take a wee break before we hit our final session can you believe that we've almost hit that time i can't but anyhow so we have a four minutes left where you can hop into networking or the expo or you know doing whatever you need to do in the next you know four minutes that's not a lot of time hopefully stand up from your desk and give yourself a bit of a shake and i thoroughly enjoyed uh sharing this last little bit of time with you three and um love that you know we're we're working so hard to keeping things real and making it meaningful for students and and uh i love how you're working through those different problems i used to laugh whenever i travel with a bag full of micro bits because i never would like to chuck check your luggage because you know you want to get there with your micro bits but let me tell you going through security with a bag full of that stuff interesting times yeah those are educational tools and they look at you like oh yeah sure but fun times have by all thanks everyone and i will let you all escape and get ready for your next thing bye thanks everyone
