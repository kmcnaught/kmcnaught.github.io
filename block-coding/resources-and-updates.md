## Additional Resources and Project Updates

This page contains updates on our ongoing work, links to related resources, and information about the broader context of accessible coding education.

## Project Background

This project is funded by the [Blockly Accessibility Fund](https://developers.google.com/blockly/accessibility), which supports efforts to make block-based coding accessible to everyone.

### Our Goals

- Make mainstream coding platforms accessible to alternative access users
- Provide practical tools that work now, not just concepts
- Build evidence through real-world testing
- Advocate for accessibility improvements in mainstream platforms
- Support educators, therapists, and families

## Recent Updates

### November 2024
- Launched new website structure with clearer navigation
- Expanded AAC vocabulary pagesets
- Continued user testing with micro:bit MakeCode grid interface

### September 2024
- Completed initial testing phase with Grid 3 interface
- Began development of Code.org Music Lab interface
- Presented findings at TechAbility conference

### Earlier Work
- Developed 7×11 and 5×8 grid layouts for Grid 3
- Created keyboard navigation guides for MakeCode
- Established user testing protocols

## Research and Publications

### Why Coding Matters

Programming opens doors to STEM careers and helps students think about problems in new ways. Understanding how computers, games and apps work empowers students to modify and build software for their own needs.

Many assistive tools are built by people who don't fully understand what life is like for AT users. We want to help students join the community of builders and create better assistive technology.

### Evidence Building

Your participation in testing and feedback helps build evidence for:

- Which access methods work best for different students
- What platform features are most important for accessibility
- How to design better block coding interfaces
- Advocacy for improvements in mainstream platforms

## Community Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community:

### Share Your Experience

- What's working well with your students?
- What challenges have you encountered?
- What creative solutions have you found?
- What features would make the biggest difference?

### Participate in Research

- User testing sessions (paid, online, flexible scheduling)
- Feedback on prototypes and interfaces
- Classroom implementation studies
- Longitudinal follow-up

### Spread the Word

- Share these resources with colleagues
- Present at conferences or training sessions
- Connect us with potential testers
- Advocate for accessibility in your school or organization

## Future Directions

### In Development

- Enhanced drag-and-drop prototypes for cursor control users
- Additional platform support as accessibility improves
- More comprehensive AAC vocabulary sets
- Video tutorial library
- Teacher training materials

### Advocacy Goals

- Keyboard navigation in Scratch
- Improved accessibility across all MakeCode platforms
- Industry-wide accessibility standards for block coding
- Integration with more AAC and access software

### Long-term Vision

- Block coding accessible to all students regardless of access method
- Mainstream platforms designed with accessibility from the start
- Strong evidence base for what works
- Active community of accessible coding practitioners
