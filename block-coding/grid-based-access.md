## Resources for grid-based access

If your student uses eye gaze with grid selection, switch scanning, or other grid-based methods, these resources provide keyboard navigation interfaces for block coding platforms.

## How it works

We've built grid interfaces that let students code without needing any cursor control. The micro:bit MakeCode editor is loaded into an embedded browser inside Grid 3, and everything works through grid cells and keyboard commands - no mouse cursor needed.

These were initially designed for eye gaze access, but they could work for any other access method including switch. Get in touch if you want to help us create new versions to suit specific access needs. 

## Platform limitations

- Grid-based control needs keyboard navigation, which is currently only available in micro:bit MakeCode. 
- We're working on developing support for Code.org Music Lab, and Blockly Games. 
- Neither Scratch nor other MakeCode platforms have keyboard navigation yet, but we expect them to adopt it in the next year or so. 
- We can also make available a prototype coding platform for creating pictures with code

## MakeCode grid interface

### Compact grid: 4 rows × 7 columns 

For users who need larger cells, this layout provides core navigation (moving blocks around) on the main page, jumps between areas of the editor with 2 steps, and a few pages 1 level down for extra functionality. This gives access to all blocks with editors that can be navigated with arrows and/or tab key, but we have not yet implemented support for typing into blocks, except for numbers. It also comes with direct links to sample projects, and an empty template project with a reduced toolbox for beginners.

### Advanced grid: 7 rows × 11 columns layout

If users who can manage with 7 rows, this allows arrow keys around the 4 edges of the screen which makes navigation simpler. This layout also has additional pages 1 level down for extra functionality, and a writing page for typing into blocks (with some caveats).

## Frequently asked questions

**Will this work for switch users?**

Yes, the grid interfaces work for switch scanning as well as eye gaze. The keyboard navigation means any access method that can activate grid cells will work.

**Do you only support Grid 3?**

We currently support Grid 3 which is what our initial testers used. Grid 3 is well suited to this task due to it's embedded browser. We are open to adapting to other software - contact us to discuss your specific access method.

**What if my student uses a different AAC/access software?**

We can work with you to adapt the interface. The underlying keyboard commands work with any software that can send keyboard input.
