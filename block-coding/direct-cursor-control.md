## Resources for Direct Cursor Control

If your student can move a cursor on screen using eye gaze, joystick, head pointer, or similar devices, these resources will help make block coding more accessible.

## What Works Across Platforms

Most block coding platforms (Scratch, MakeCode, Code.org Music Lab) are built on similar technology called Blockly. This means general tips and tricks work across all of them when using direct cursor control.

### Tips for Easier Block Coding

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #2a7ae2; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #f8f9fa;">
    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Workspace Organization</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Zoom in to make blocks larger and easier to grab</li>
        <li>Use the "Clean up blocks" feature to organize your workspace</li>
        <li>Delete unused blocks to reduce clutter</li>
        <li>Practice in an empty project first</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Dragging Strategies</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Take your time - there's no rush</li>
        <li>Break complex moves into smaller steps</li>
        <li>Use the undo button (Ctrl+Z) if something goes wrong</li>
        <li>Snap blocks together from the side rather than from above</li>
    </ul>

## Improved Dragging Prototype

**Status: Testing Available**

We've developed a prototype that makes dragging easier for eye gaze and other alternative access users. This prototype includes:

- Improved target areas for grabbing blocks
- Smoother drag behavior with less precision required
- Better visual feedback during dragging
- Adjustable sensitivity settings

<div style="border: 2px solid #e67e22; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #fef5e7;">
    <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Want to test this prototype?</strong></p>
    <p>We're currently seeking testers for this feature. If you'd like early access, please <a href="mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com">contact us</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUwZBrLn7O6XstouOKBpPTYDqz-kaxeoqoJMx4yrz-rHLksg/viewform">fill in our registration form</a>.</p>

## User Video Guides

**Status: Coming Soon**

We're creating video guides showing real users demonstrating tips, tricks, and workarounds for block coding with alternative access. These will include:

- Step-by-step tutorials for common tasks
- Troubleshooting common challenges
- Success stories from students and practitioners
- Platform-specific guidance for Scratch, MakeCode, and Code.org

Check back soon or [sign up for updates](mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com).

## Platform-Specific Notes

### MakeCode (micro:bit, Arcade, Minecraft)
- Generally good cursor control support
- Keyboard shortcuts available (useful for some access methods)
- Can switch between blocks and text-based code

### Scratch
- Large, colorful blocks are easier to see
- Good zoom functionality
- Active community with lots of example projects

### Code.org (including Music Lab)
- Tutorial-based learning structure
- Simplified interface for beginners
- Music Lab is particularly engaging for younger students

## Need Grid-Based Access Instead?

If direct cursor control is too challenging, grid-based access methods may be more appropriate for your student. [Learn about grid-based access resources →](../grid-based-access)

## Questions or Feedback?

We want to hear about your experiences using these platforms with alternative access.
