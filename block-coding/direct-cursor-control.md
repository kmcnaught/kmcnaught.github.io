## Resources for Direct Cursor Control

If your student can move a cursor on screen using eye gaze, joystick, head pointer, or similar devices, these resources will help make block coding more accessible.

## What platforms does this work with?

Most block coding platforms (Scratch, MakeCode, Code.org Music Lab) are built with the same underlaying technology, called Blockly. This means general tips and tricks work across all of them when using direct cursor control. We've also prototyped a simple coding app where you can try out coding without needing to 'drag and drop', but this version is not yet available in mainstream coding platforms.

## Video guides for eye gaze

We are producing video guides to introduce you to using eye gaze (with direct pointer control) for coding in the micro:bit MakeCode editor.

One of the biggest challenges to coding with eye gaze is dragging blocks around using direct pointer control. In our first video, keen coder Becky shows different ways she uses TD Control to drag blocks with her Tobii Dynavox eye tracker.

## Prototype - moving blocks with a pointing device, without using a drag.

Drag-and-drop style interactions are a common challenge for many users of assistive technology, and unfortunately they play a huge part in block coding interfaces. We've developed a prototype that avoids any dragging to make coding easier for eye gaze and other alternative access users. 

This prototype includes:

- Move blocks using only single clicks. 
- Click a block twice to put it in move mode.
- See all the options for where to place the block. 
- Click directly on a connection to place the block there.

To try out the prototype in a minimal environment, go to our [testing page](https://kmcnaught.co.uk/blockly-keyboard-experimentation-eye-gaze/release/demo-15-oct-25/minimal-demo.html?mode=click&trigger=focused_click&highlightSize=large&optionsVisible=true). If you want to do some actual coding with it, have a play with [drawing a face](https://kmcnaught.co.uk/blockly-keyboard-experimentation-eye-gaze/release/demo-15-oct-25/?toolbox=custom&scenario=face&renderer=zelos) or [drawing a landscape](https://kmcnaught.co.uk/blockly-keyboard-experimentation-eye-gaze/release/demo-15-oct-25/?toolbox=custom&scenario=landscape&renderer=zelos) in our homemade coding app.

    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Workspace Organisation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Zoom in to make blocks larger and easier to grab</li>
        <li>Use the "Clean up blocks" feature to organise your workspace</li>
        <li>Delete unused blocks to reduce clutter</li>
        <li>Practice in an empty/small project first</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Dragging Strategies</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If your eye tracker supports a continuous drag (where you see the block move as you go) this works better than having to decide the end point without any visual feedback.</li>
        <li>When you want to move a block **inside another block**, you need to make sure the block lines up with the connection point</li>
        <li>Grab the left-hand end of a block to ensure it lands in the right place</li>        
        <li>If you are using the micro:bit MakeCode editor, you can use keyboard controls to move a block - see  <a href="https://microbit.org/accessibility/microsoft-makecode/#keyboard-navigation">keyboard navigation in MakeCode</a>. Some users may prefer to use an on-screen keyboard to move blocks around.</li>

## Need Grid-Based Access Instead?

If direct cursor control is too challenging, grid-based access methods may be more appropriate for your student. [Learn about grid-based access resources →](../grid-based-access)

## Questions or Feedback?

We want to hear about your experiences using these platforms with alternative access.
