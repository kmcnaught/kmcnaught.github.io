## AAC coding vocabulary resources

For students who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, having the right vocabulary is essential for discussing and explaining their coding work. This is especially important as they quickly outgrow the knowledge of the adults around them, and need to explain what they are trying to do. 

Some students who do not yet have the assistive tech setup to enable them to code independently, may be able to use an AAC pageset to dictate their code to an assistant to get started. 

## Why AAC vocabulary matters

When students learn to code, they need to:

- Discuss their ideas and plans
- Ask for help when stuck
- Explain what their code does
- Debug problems with teachers or peers
- Share their achievements

Getting core vocabulary into their AAC device helps reduce communication barriers.

## Available formats

We can provide vocabulary pagesets in formats compatible with popular AAC systems:

- Grid 3
- Tobii Dynavox systems
- Proloquo2Go
- TouchChat
- LAMP Words for Life
- Other systems on request

## Getting the pagesets

    <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Download Coding Vocabulary</strong></p>
    <p>Contact us to receive pagesets in your AAC system's format:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com">Email to request specific format</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUwZBrLn7O6XstouOKBpPTYDqz-kaxeoqoJMx4yrz-rHLksg/viewform">Request via registration form</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us know what AAC system you use and what coding platform you're working with, and we'll provide appropriate vocabulary.</p>
</div>

## Customization support

Every student's vocabulary needs are different. We can help customize pagesets for different software.

- Match your student's existing vocabulary organisation
- Add project-specific or platform-specific terms
- Adjust complexity level for age and ability
- Integrate with existing communication boards
- Support specific learning goals

### Asterics Grid

AsTeRICS Grid is a free, web-based platform offering customizable grids for communication and control, supporting various input devices and user interfaces. 

Check out some [Asterics gridsets from Loreto Dumitrescu at Zero Day Camp](https://zeroday.camp/giving-your-students-accessible-cs-alternative-communication-for-collaboration/) or get in touch if you want Asterics conversions of any of the gridsets shared below.

### Grid 3

[Grid](https://thinksmartbox.com/grid/) is commercial software for communication and access on Windows devices, commonly used in schools with several AAC users. If you don't have a license already, you can download a free 60-day trial to check it out.

</div>

## Integration with access methods

These vocabulary pagesets work alongside our other resources:

- **Grid-based coding users**: Vocabulary can be integrated with the coding grid interface
- **Direct cursor control users**: Separate communication board for discussing code
- **Combined approach**: Switch between coding and communication modes

## Why this matters

Students who use AAC shouldn't have to choose between coding and communicating about their code. Having proper vocabulary means they can:

- Participate fully in classroom coding activities
- Collaborate with peers on coding projects
- Develop computational thinking skills
- Advocate for their own learning needs
- Build confidence as coders

## Feedback welcome

We're continuously improving these vocabulary sets based on real-world use.

**What we want to know:**
- What vocabulary is missing?
- What terms do students use most often?
- How can we better organise the vocabulary?
- What integration features would help?
