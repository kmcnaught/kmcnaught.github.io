## AAC Coding Vocabulary Resources

For students who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, having the right vocabulary is essential for discussing and explaining their coding work.

## Why AAC Vocabulary Matters

When students learn to code, they need to:

- Discuss their ideas and plans
- Ask for help when stuck
- Explain what their code does
- Debug problems with teachers or peers
- Share their achievements

Without coding-specific vocabulary in their AAC device, these conversations become unnecessarily difficult.

## Coding Vocabulary Pagesets

**Status: Ready to Use**

We've developed AAC pagesets that include essential coding vocabulary for block-based programming.

### What's Included

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #2a7ae2; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #f8f9fa;">
    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Core Coding Concepts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Block, code, program, script</li>
        <li>Start, stop, run, test</li>
        <li>Bug, error, fix, debug</li>
        <li>Change, delete, move, connect</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #2a7ae2; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #f8f9fa;">
    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Programming Actions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If, then, else, repeat, forever</li>
        <li>Variable, value, number, text</li>
        <li>True, false, and, or, not</li>
        <li>Function, input, output</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #2a7ae2; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #f8f9fa;">
    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Project-Specific Terms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Platform-specific vocabulary (micro:bit, Scratch, etc.)</li>
        <li>Sensor and hardware terms</li>
        <li>Animation and graphics vocabulary</li>
        <li>Game and music coding terms</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #2a7ae2; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #f8f9fa;">
    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Communication Functions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I want to try...</li>
        <li>This doesn't work</li>
        <li>Can you help me with...</li>
        <li>I made a mistake</li>
        <li>Look what I made!</li>
    </ul>
</div>

## Available Formats

We can provide vocabulary pagesets in formats compatible with popular AAC systems:

- Grid 3
- Tobii Dynavox systems
- Proloquo2Go
- TouchChat
- LAMP Words for Life
- Other systems on request

## Getting the Pagesets

<div style="border: 2px solid #27ae60; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #eafaf1;">
    <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Download Coding Vocabulary</strong></p>
    <p>Contact us to receive pagesets in your AAC system's format:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com">Email to request specific format</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUwZBrLn7O6XstouOKBpPTYDqz-kaxeoqoJMx4yrz-rHLksg/viewform">Request via registration form</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us know what AAC system you use and what coding platform you're working with, and we'll provide appropriate vocabulary.</p>
</div>

## Customization Support

Every student's vocabulary needs are different. We can help customize pagesets to:

- Match your student's existing vocabulary organization
- Add project-specific terms
- Adjust complexity level for age and ability
- Integrate with existing communication boards
- Support specific learning goals

## Integration with Access Methods

These vocabulary pagesets work alongside our other resources:

- **Grid-based coding users**: Vocabulary can be integrated with the coding grid interface
- **Direct cursor control users**: Separate communication board for discussing code
- **Combined approach**: Switch between coding and communication modes

## Why This Matters

Students who use AAC shouldn't have to choose between coding and communicating about their code. Having proper vocabulary means they can:

- Participate fully in classroom coding activities
- Collaborate with peers on coding projects
- Develop computational thinking skills
- Advocate for their own learning needs
- Build confidence as coders

## Feedback Welcome

We're continuously improving these vocabulary sets based on real-world use.

**What we want to know:**
- What vocabulary is missing?
- What terms do students use most often?
- How can we better organize the vocabulary?
- What integration features would help?
