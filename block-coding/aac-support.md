## AAC coding vocabulary resources

For students who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, having the right vocabulary is essential for discussing and explaining their coding work. Students can quickly outgre their teacher's coding knowledge, and need to explain what they are trying to achieve. 

Some students who do not yet have the assistive tech setup to enable them to code independently, may be able to use an AAC pageset to dictate their code to an assistant to get started. 

## Why AAC vocabulary matters

When students learn to code, they need to:

- Discuss their ideas and plans
- Ask for help when stuck
- Explain what their code does
- Debug problems with teachers or peers
- Share their achievements

Getting core vocabulary into their AAC device helps reduce communication barriers.

## Coding vocabulary pagesets

We are developing shared resources to allow people to more quickly jump into coding.

### Asterics Grid

Loreto Dumitrescu at Zero Day Camp has created gridsets for Asterics Grid. Check out their full blog post at the following link: [Giving Your Students Accessible CS Alternative Communication for Collaboration
](https://zeroday.camp/giving-your-students-accessible-cs-alternative-communication-for-collaboration/)


<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <img src="../images/asterics_page.png" alt="Asterics gridset home page" style="width: 80%; max-width: 800px;" />
</div>

### Grid 3

Our first Grid 3 pageset includes comprehensive coding vocabulary and MakeCode-specific words for blocks in the micro:bit MakeCode editor. This comes in a grid with 10 columns, 8 cells. For alternative layouts in Grid 3 or other AAC apps, [email us](mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com) with an empty vocabulary template and we'll send you a version that fits the required layout. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/23a733ccd7084d84adab8cf966c3822f" title="Loom video player: Grid3 AAC pageset 10x8" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
<br>

#### What's included
- Categorised block vocabulary for micro:bit code, such as "show", "icon".
- Categorised options for blocks such as icon names ("happy", "sad", "giraffe") or melodies ("dadadum", "ode", "funk")
- Various social phrases - taken from the above Asterics pages, to ask for help, give feedback, or troubleshoot coding problems 
- Various coding and micro:bit-related concepts and vocabulary, such as "crocodile clips", "array", "return"

#### Download
#FIXME: put a coloured div here, like you have elsewhere, to make an obviosu call to action to download the file

## Other formats

We are working on pagesets for TD Snap, and Grid 3 pages with fewer rows/columns. [Email us](mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com) to request a specific format. 

## Getting the pagesets

<div style="border: 2px solid #27ae60; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #eafaf1;">
    <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Download Coding Vocabulary</strong></p>
    <p>Contact us to receive pagesets in your AAC system's format:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com">Email to request specific format</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUwZBrLn7O6XstouOKBpPTYDqz-kaxeoqoJMx4yrz-rHLksg/viewform">Request via registration form</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us know what AAC system you use and what coding platform you're working with, and we'll provide appropriate vocabulary.</p>
</div>

## Customisation support

Every student's vocabulary needs are different. We can help customize pagesets for different software.

- Match your student's existing vocabulary organisation
- Add project-specific or platform-specific terms
- Adjust complexity level for age and ability
- Integrate with existing communication boards
- Support specific learning goals

### Asterics Grid

AsTeRICS Grid is a free, web-based platform offering customizable grids for communication and control, supporting various input devices and user interfaces. 

Check out some [Asterics gridsets from Loreto Dumitrescu at Zero Day Camp](https://zeroday.camp/giving-your-students-accessible-cs-alternative-communication-for-collaboration/) or get in touch if you want Asterics conversions of any of the gridsets shared below.

### Grid 3

[Grid](https://thinksmartbox.com/grid/) is commercial software for communication and access on Windows devices, commonly used in schools with several AAC users. If you don't have a license already, you can download a free 60-day trial to check it out.

Full AAC gridset for coding in MakeCode with micro:bit

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">

</div>

## Integration with access methods

These vocabulary pagesets work alongside our other resources:

- **Grid-based coding users**: Vocabulary can be integrated with the coding grid interface
- **Direct cursor control users**: Separate communication board for discussing code
- **Combined approach**: Switch between coding and communication modes

## Feedback welcome

We're continuously improving these vocabulary sets based on real-world use.
