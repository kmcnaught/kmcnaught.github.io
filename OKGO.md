*OK, Game On!* (working title) or "OKGO" is a Windows application offering eye control access to many games via keyboard, mouse and gamepad emulation. It is based on the excellent Optikey and EyeMine projects. 

It is currently under development, please contact kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com if you'd like to try the app as a beta tester, offer feedback and receive individualised support.

### Installing OK, Game On

1. Install the latest version of ViGemBus from [Latest ViGemReleases on github](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases) (run *ViGEmBusSetup_x86.msi* or *ViGEmBusSetup_x64.msi* depending if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit PC)

2. Secondly, install OK Game On itself: [Latest OKGO releases on github](https://github.com/kmcnaught/OKGO/releases/)

### Recommendations

- You should not have any other USB controllers connected to your PC - OKGO will create a virtual one that you can see in the “Game Controllers” list in Windows, and many games don’t like more than one controller attached

- Some games may be sensitive to launch order - e.g. they require OKGO to be running before the game is launched (or maybe vice versa). Feedback is very welcome if you take notes on this

- Sometimes it may be necessary to set your game to use “fullscreen windowed” or “windowed” + maximised 

- If the game isn't responding to OKGO, make sure the game has focus by clicking on the game

### Included keyboards

OK Game On comes bundled with starter interfaces for a few different games as well as generic interfaces to try out the controls. If you've tried the controls and want to build a custom interface, talk to me!
