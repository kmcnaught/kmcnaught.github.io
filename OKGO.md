*OK, Game On!* (working title) or "OKGO" is a Windows application offering eye control access to many games via keyboard, mouse and gamepad emulation. It is based on the excellent Optikey and EyeMine projects.

It is currently under development, please contact kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com if you'd like to try the app as a beta tester, offer feedback and receive individualised support. 

### Installing OK, Game On
1. Install the latest version of ViGemBus from https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases (run ViGEmBusSetup_x86.msi or ViGEmBusSetup_x64.msi depending if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit PC)
2. Secondly, install OK Game On:  [OKGameOnSetup-1.0.6.msi](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qr24rqx0eykqkpt/OKGameOnSetup-1.0.6.msi?dl=1)

### Recommendations
- You should not have any other USB controllers connected to your PC - OK Game On will create a virtual one that you can see in the “Game Controllers” list in Windows, and many games don’t like more than one controller attached
- You may find some games are sensitive to launch order - e.g. they require OK Game On to be running before the game is launched (or maybe vice versa). Feedback is very welcome if you take notes on this
- OKGO can work with full-screen games, but sometimes it may be necessary to set yout game to use “fullscreen windowed” or “windowed” + maximised in order to work nicely
- If the game isn't responding to OKGO, make sure the game has focus by clicking on the game

### Included keyboards
OK Game On comes bundled with starter interfaces for a few different games as well as generic interfaces to try out the controls. If you've tried the controls and want to build a custom interface, talk to me!
