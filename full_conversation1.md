## User
I want you to write an alphabet list, where each word starts with each letter of the alphabet. I want the words to be chosen to be relevant to a particular topic. For example, if the topic is "animals", the list might start with: A: Ant B: Bat C: Cat ... Z: Zebra Please write me a complete list from A to Z where the topic is "animals" do not include any links, just include the letter and the word, with each one on a new line


## Gpt-4 answer
Sure, here is an alphabet list where each word is an animal that starts with each corresponding letter of the alphabet:

```makefile
A: Antelope
B: Bear
C: Cheetah
D: Dolphin
E: Elephant
F: Fox
G: Gorilla
H: Hippopotamus
I: Iguana
J: Jackal
K: Kangaroo
L: Lion
M: Monkey
N: Nightingale
O: Ostrich
P: Penguin
Q: Quail
R: Rabbit
S: Snake
T: Tiger
U: Uakari (a type of monkey)
V: Vulture
W: Wolf
X: X-ray Tetra (a type of fish)
Y: Yak
Z: Zebra
```

This list should cover animals from A to Z. Please note that for some letters like 'X', there are very few animals that start with that letter, so the options are limited.
