I am available to hire as a consultant. I bring experience from early stage startups and the world of academic research. I can bridge this gap for clients who want to bring research into the real world. I have a keen appreciation for product usability, a good awareness of accessibility and a breadth of software development experience. I speak the language of academics, users, developers and business practitioners.

### What can I do for you?

I work on a freelance basis, helping companies to:
- build accessible software
- adapt existing games for eye-gaze users
- turn lab prototypes into user-friendly professional-quality applications
- understand accessibility concerns and assistive technology 

### Past consulting projects


#### CraytaAccess - building games with eye control
I worked with [Unit2 Games](https://unit2games.com/) to build an eye-controlled interface for [Crayta](https://www.crayta.com/) to allow users with physical disabilities to build their own games with everyone else. 

#### EyeMine - eye controlled Minecraft
EyeMine is a project that allows players with disabilities to access Minecraft using only eye control. It was built for the charity SpecialEffect, and is entirely open source.

#### The Open Voice Factory - communication aids for all 
In the early stages of the Open Voice Factory project (previously named 'AzuleJoe') I developed a Qt-based cross-platform app based on a prototype web interface for symbol communication. The project won the inaugural Nesta Inclusive Technology prize.

#### Fuel3D handheld 3D scanner
After Fuel3D launched a successful kickstarter to convert their medical technology into a consumer product, I joined the team as a research & development consultant to lead the development of the core computer vision algorithms.

### Previous employment experience
I started my career in engineering consulting, working for [Arup](https://www.arup.com/) as a pre-university student and during vacations throughout my Engineering degree. Most of this time I worked for the [Advanced Technology & Research Group](https://www.arup.com/expertise/services/technical-consulting/advanced-technology-and-research), where I built systems for remote monitoring and automated data analysis. After graduating I first worked as a software developer at Eykona Technologies (now [Fuel3d](https://www.fuel3d.com/)) and later was joint first technical employee at [DotProduct GmbH](https://www.dotproduct3d.com/). In these roles I learned about the practical concerns involved in translating academic research into a viable business - including working on large collaborative codebases and the importance of quality user experience design.
