I am available to hire as a consultant. I bring experience from early stage startups and the world of academic research. I can bridge this gap for clients who want to bring research into the real world. I have a keen appreciation for product usability, a breadth of software development experience but I also speak the language of academics. 

### Past projects

#### EyeMine - eye controlled Minecraft
EyeMine is a project that allows players to access Minecraft using only eye control. It was built for SpecialEffect, and is entirely open source.

#### The Open Voice Factory - communication aids for all 
In the early stages of the Open Voice Factory project (previously named 'AzuleJoe') I developed a Qt-based cross-platform app based on an existing web interface for symbol communication. The project won the inaugural Nesta Inclusive Technology prize.

#### Fuel3D handheld 3D scanner
After Fuel3D launched a successful kickstarter to convert their medical technology into a consumer product, I joined the team as a research & development consultant to work on the computer vision algorithms and product design.
