Path Hill Outdoors 

The Porch Steppin' Stone  

Path Hill Outdoors is a not for profit organisation delivering exciting outdoor education programmes to schools, youth groups and individuals, focussing on providing re-engagement programmes for young people who don't get on at school.
My work at Path Hill (initially as a volunteer, then as a freelance instructor) has involved working one-to-one and with groups of behaviourally-challenged children as well as general school visits.
