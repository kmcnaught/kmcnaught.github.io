# Pedagogical inspiration
I love good interactive learning materials such as the explorable explanations by Nicky Case (http://ncase.me/) and others. 

[3Blue1Brown's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) contains beautiful intuitive explanations of core mathematics as well as more esoteric maths results. If you're studying any quantitative field, you should definitely watch his [Essence of linear algebra course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).

# Miscellaneous
GiveWell/Effective Altruism


I am passionate about pedagogy and making education accessible to all backgrounds. In the Gatsby Unit, I am a teaching assistant on the Theoretical Neuroscience course, giving tutorials to experimental students which bridge the gap between their neuroscience background and the heavily mathematical theory taught by the Gatsby faculty.
