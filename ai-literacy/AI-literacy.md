# Experiments with AI to create bespoke early literacy activities

Inspired by conversations with Claire Harrison and Tina Voizey at the Communication Matters conference, I had a play with AI chat interfaces to generate materials for emergent literacy activities. Tina’s suggested starting point was creating A-Z alphabet lists on a student’s favourite theme, which was a great success. I also looked at generating simple sentences for letter recognition and comprehension based on the Stranger Things TV Series.

All conversations were carried out using [Phind Search](https://www.phind.com/) which I happened to have a $30 subscription for already. I would expect ChatGPT's free offering to be slightly inferior in the answers, but these models are improving at such a rate I am confident these results are representative of what is becoming feasible. 

## Goal

Automatically generate material for particular literacy activities, uniquely themed around a user's interests. This might include very early literacy activities which are age-appropriate for a young adult. 

# Experiment 1

I wanted to generate A-Z lists around different themes. This can take a long time to come up with by hand but is easy for AI. It might also be good to have several alternatives, so you could for instance have a class activity choosing your favourite word for each letter from a short list, to go into a shared book.
