Many children first learn to code at school using block coding platforms like Scratch, Code.org or MakeCode. These are designed to be easy to use, but the "drag and drop" method can be challenging for students who use eye gaze, switch access or other alternative inputs for computer control. 

This project is funded by the [Blockly Accessibility Fund](https://developers.google.com/blockly/accessibility-fund). We're developing free solutions to help eye gaze users access block coding platforms.

## What we're building

We're creating new ways for people to code using eye gaze and switch access. No cursor control needed - everything works through grid interfaces.

### Work so far

We've been working on the [micro:bit MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org), which was the first Blockly-based tool to add keyboard controls. We've built interfaces in Grid 3 using a 7x11 grid layout. We can also make smaller grids (5 rows, 8 columns) if that works better for you.

Here's a demo video showing how it works:

    </a>
</div>

### What's next

We're next working with Code.org's Music Lab, to make some fun tunes! This will be a simpler environment, more suitable for beginners and those with higher access needs. We'll keep using Grid 3 but will adapt to other software too.

## Who this project is for

**Main focus**: Eye gaze or head mouse users who find direct pointer control challenging.

**Also welcome**: Switch users who can test the same grid interfaces.

All ages 8+ welcome. No coding experience needed.

## Why coding matters

Programming opens doors to STEM careers and helps you think about problems in new ways. If you understand the concepts behind how computers, games and apps work, you can modify and build software for your own needs. 

Many assistive tools are built by people who don't know truly understand what your life is like. Join them and help build better assistive tech. Or make your own projects - games, apps, home automation, anything you can imagine.

## Frequently asked questions

**Will this work for switch users?**  
Yes, many of the interfaces work for switch access too. Get in touch for support and early access.

**Do I need to control the mouse cursor?**  
No. Everything works through grid cells - no cursor control needed.

**Do you only support Grid 3?**  
No, that's just what our user testers so far have had. We'll adapt to whatever setup you have.

**Can I become a professional developer?**  
Maybe! Software is an accessible career since it doesn't matter how you operate your computer. New AI tools are making coding even more accessible. But you don't need to be a professional coder to have fun with block coding - there are lots of fun activities for everyone.
