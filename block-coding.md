In many cases, a child's first introduction to coding is at school, using a block coding platform, such as Scratch, Code.org or MakeCode. Although these may be easy to use for many children, the "drag and drop" method of interaction can be a significant challenge for those individuals who use eye gaze to access their schoolwork.

This project is funded by the [Blockly Accessibility Fund](https://developers.google.com/blockly/accessibility-fund), and focuses on developing open solutions to provide eye gaze access to block coding platforms for individuals with severe physical disabilities. 

### Project Overview

This project will involve developing, testing, and evaluating eye gaze interfaces to facilitate learning and exploration of block-based coding for disabled students. This work runs alongside the other [Blockly accessibility funded projects](https://developers.google.com/blockly/accessibility-fund-recipients) which aim to make block-based coding more inclusive and available for everyone. 

### Platforms supported

The main focus of user testing is likely to involve a beta version of the [micro:bit MakeCode editor](makecode.microbit.org) to ensure the latest Blockly accessibility features, but students using other platforms based on Blockly are also welcome to contribute their experiences. Any changes to the underlying platforms are expected to be percolated through the Blockly ecosystem over time.


### Activities

#### Prototype development

We will implement eye gaze access in a free, open source application based on [Optikey](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/) as well as creating free-to-share gridsets for common AAC and eye gaze software, such as [Grid](https://thinksmartbox.com/grid/). We will be steered by user requests and provide interfaces and materials in whatever form is most helpful. 

#### User testing

We will run user testing throughout this project. [Contact us](mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com) to register interest. There will be voucher incentives available for all students who take part, and additional follow-up support available to ensure continued access wherever possible.

#### Resource development

By the end of the project, we will share free online guides to support teachers and students with accessing block coding using eye gaze. 

### Getting involved
If you are an eye gaze user, or work with one, and want to be involved, we would love to hear from you! Please [send an email](mailto:kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com) to find out more.
