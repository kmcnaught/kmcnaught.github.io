I am passionate about pedagogy and making education accessible to all backgrounds. In the Gatsby Unit, I am a teaching assistant on the Theoretical Neuroscience course, giving tutorials to experimental students which bridge the gap between their neuroscience background and the heavily mathematical theory taught by the Gatsby faculty. I have also taught introductory neuroanatomy for machine learning students, and version control (git) for scientists.

During the taught programme in the Gatsby I wrote some notes on theoretical neuroscience, which may be useful for other students. 
These can be found on the course webpage: [Systems & Theoretical Neuroscience 2018-19](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/sntn/sntn-2017/induction.html).
