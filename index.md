I am an engineer with a passion for building user-friendly applications to enable technology that makes a difference to individual's lives. I have a wide range of technology experience including computer vision, machine learning, and alternative input methods such as eye gaze. My experience in both industry and academia allows me to translate between business concerns, usability and technical constraints. I build robust and useable applications for the real world. 

I work on open-source assistive technology projects, and am passionate about using technology to help empower individuals and break down unnecessary access barriers. 

I believe in the power of play to allow all children to explore worlds, be creative and build social connections with their peers.     

I have experience working in early-stage technology startups in the field of computer vision, where I have worked on algorithms, product development and user experience design. I can help companies to translate promising lab protoypes from current-edge research into intuitive and easy to use applications. 

I am available to hire as a [consultant](consulting).
