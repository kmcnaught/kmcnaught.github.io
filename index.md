I am an engineer, neuroscientist and programmer. 

I have experience working in early-stage technology startups in the field of computer vision, where I have worked on algorithms, product development and user experience design. I also work on open-source assistive technology projects, and am passionate about using technology to help individuals lead a richer life. I am an MPhil student at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, where I received intensive training in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience and carry out research on human visual attention.
