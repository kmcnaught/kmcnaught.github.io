On this page you will find some notes I made whilst studying - and TAing - the Gatsby/SWC courses in theoretical neuroscience and machine learning. They may vary in their depth, quality and correctness. Please give feedback if you find any errors, or if you have any problems accessing them - alternative formats available on request. 


During the taught programme in the Gatsby I wrote some notes on theoretical neuroscience, which may be useful for other students. 
These can be found on my Gatsby homepage: http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~kirstym/

I do some teaching and stuff.

I like interactive visualisations.

I am available to hire.
