I am an MPhil student in the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, working with Maneesh Sahani and Aapo Hyvarinen. I am particularly interested in how the brain deals with uncertainty and makes decisions consistent with information theoretic principles. My current work explores eye movements within a foveated system from the perspective of information gain. 

# Academic background

- *2016 - 2018*  MPhil Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit
  - In the first (taught) year I studied intensive courses in Machine Learning, Theoretical Neuroscience, Kernel Methods and Neural Data Analysis.
  - In the second year I taught accessible Theoretical Neuroscience to experimental first-year students and wrote accompanying assignments.
 
- *2012 - 2013*  Research assistant in Mobile Robotics Group, Oxford University
  - While in the Mobile Robotics Group, I designed and built a commercial prototype of a portable indoor laser mapping system using 2D LIDAR, stereo camera and IMU, to showcase the group’s recent research in 3D mapping. This involved mechanical design, software development and systems integration.

- *2007 - 2011*  MEng Engineering Science, Oxford (Lady Margaret Hall), Double First Class Honours
  - In my master's year I specialised in both Information and Biomedical Engineering. For my thesis I designed a system that used computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically classify tissue types within chronic wounds, based on RGB-D images. This involved techniques such as unsupervised image segmentation, data collection and labelling, feature selection, multiclass classification and local filtering. For this research project I won 2 prizes at Oxford, and was a 2011 SET Awards finalist.
