I am an MPhil student in the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, working with Maneesh Sahani and Aapo Hyvarinen. I am particularly interested in how the brain deals with uncertainty and makes decisions consistent with information theoretic principles. My current work explores eye movements within a foveated system from the perspective of information gain.
